to make a contribution to his or her community.”</p></blockquote><p>The WHO stress that mental health is “more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.” Peak mental health is about not only avoiding active conditions but also looking after ongoing wellness and happiness.</p><p>They also emphasize that preserving and restoring mental health is crucial on an individual basis, as

conditions</a></div></h2><p>Everyone has some risk of developing a mental health disorder, no matter their age, sex, income, or ethnicity. </p><p>In the U.S. and much of the developed world, mental disorders are <a class=\"content-link css-29oowu\" href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/disability/us-leading-categories-of-diseases-disorders.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">one of the leading causes</a> of disability.</p><p>Social and financial circumstances, biological factors, and lifestyle choices can all shape a person’s mental health.</p><p>A large proportion of people with a mental health disorder have more than one condition at a time. </p><p>It is important to note that good mental health depends on a delicate balance of factors and that several elements of life and the world at large can work together to contribute to disorders.</p><p>The following factors may contribute to mental health disruptions.</p><h3>Continuous social and economic pressure </h3><p>Having limited financial means or belonging to a marginalized or persecuted ethnic group can increase the risk of mental health disorders.</p><p>A <a class=\"content-link css-29oowu\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4764285/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2015 study</a> of 903 families in Iran identified several socioeconomic causes of mental health conditions, including poverty and living on the outskirts of a large city.</p><p>The researchers also explained the difference in the availability and quality of mental health treatment for certain groups in terms of modifiable factors, which can change over time, and nonmodifiable factors, which are permanent.</p><p>Modifiable factors for mental health disorders include:</p><ul><li>socioeconomic conditions, such whether work is available in the local area</li><li>occupation</li><li>a person’s level of social involvement</li><li>education</li><li>housing quality</li></ul><p>Nonmodifiable factors include:</p><ul><li>gender</li><li>age</li><li>ethnicity</li></ul><p>The study lists gender as both a modifiable and nonmodifiable factor. The researchers found that being female increased the risk of low mental health status by 3.96 times. </p><p>People with a “weak economic status” also scored highest for mental health conditions in this study.</p><h3>Biological factors</h3><p>The NIMH suggest that genetic family history can <a class=\"content-link css-29oowu\" href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/looking-at-my-genes/index.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">increase the likelihood</a> of mental health conditions, as certain genes and gene variants put a person at higher risk. </p><p>However, many other factors contribute to the development of these disorders. </p><p>Having a gene with links to a mental health disorder, such as depression or schizophrenia, does not guarantee that a condition will develop. Likewise, people without related genes or a family history of mental illness can still have mental health issues. </p><p>Mental health conditions such as stress, depression, and anxiety may develop due to underlying, life-changing physical health problems, such as cancer, diabetes, and chronic pain.</p><div class=\"css-umsscj\"><aside class=\"css-0\"><div><div class=\"css-10gx9pb\" data-empty=\"true\"><div class=\"css-1hjaa0k\"><span class=\"css-zya54r\"></span></div><div class=\"css-12zon3z\" data-ad=\"true\" id=\"inline2__slot\"></div></div></div></aside></div></div><span class=\"css-zya54r\"></span><div class=\"css-0\"><span style=\"font-size:0\"></span><h2><div><a name=\"common-disorders\">Common mental health disorders</a></div></h2><p>The most common types of mental illness are as follows: </p><ul><li><a class=\"content-link css-29oowu keywords\" href=\"/info/anxiety/\" title=\"What is Anxiety?\">anxiety</a> disorders</li><li>mood disorders</li><li><a class=\"content-link css-29oowu keywords\" href=\"/articles/36942.php\" title=\"Understanding the symptoms of schizophrenia\">schizophrenia</a> disorders</li></ul><h3>Anxiety disorders</h3><p>According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders are the <a class=\"content-link css-29oowu\" href=\"https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">most common type</a> of mental illness.</p><p>People with these conditions have severe fear or anxiety, which relates to certain objects or situations.

The individual will have thoughts that appear fragmented, and they may also find it hard to process information.</p><p>Schizophrenia has negative and positive symptoms. Positive symptoms include delusions, thought disorders, and hallucinations. Negative symptoms include withdrawal, lack of motivation, and a flat or inappropriate mood. </p><p><a class=\"content-link css-29oowu\" href=\"/articles/36942.php\">Learn more about schizophrenia here.</a></p><div class=\"css-1sxbpyw\" id=\"hl-incontent-video-ad\"></div><div class=\"css-1h5aco8\" id=\"div-gpt-ad-out-of-page\"></div><div class=\"css-1cg0byz\"><aside class=\"css-0\"><div><div class=\"css-az6x7v\" data-empty=\"true\"><div class=\"css-1hjaa0k\"><span class=\"css-zya54r\"></span></div><div class=\"css-eykv1o\" data-ad=\"true\" id=\"inline3__slot\"></div></div></div></aside></div></div><span class=\"css-zya54r\"></span><div class=\"css-0\"><span style=\"font-size:0\"></span><h2><div><a name=\"early-signs\">Early signs</a></div></h2><p>There is no physical test or scan that reliably indicates whether a person has developed a mental illness.

Other drugs either boost the overall levels of these chemicals or prevent their degradation or destruction. </p><p><a class=\"content-link css-29oowu\" href=\"/articles/248320\">Find out more about antidepressant medications here.</a></p><h3><strong>Self-help</strong></h3><p>A person coping with mental health difficulties will usually need to make changes to their lifestyle to facilitate wellness.</p><p>Such changes might include reducing alcohol intake, sleeping more, and eating a <a class=\"content-link css-29oowu\" href=\"/articles/327335\">balanced, nutritious diet</a>. People may need to take time away from work or resolve issues with personal relationships that may be causing damage to their mental health.</p><p>People with conditions such as an anxiety or depressive disorder may benefit from relaxation techniques, which include deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness. </p><p>Having a support network, whether via self-help groups or close friends and family, can also be essential to recovery from mental illness.</p><span><div class=\"css-1rtngoe\"><div class=\"css-10550dw\"><div><h3 class=\"css-hxnjhz\">Suicide prevention</h3><div class=\"css-13ifv4s\"><p>If you know someone at immediate risk of self-harm, suicide, or hurting another person:</p><ul><li>Ask the tough question: “Are you considering suicide?”</li><li>Listen to the person without judgment.</li><li>Call 911 or the local emergency number, or text TALK to 741741 to communicate with a trained crisis counselor.</li><li>Stay with the person until professional help arrives.</li><li>Try to remove any weapons, medications, or other potentially harmful objects.</li></ul><p>If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, a prevention hotline can help.

The WHO constitution states: \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" An important implication of this definition is that mental health is more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities. Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community. Mental health is fundamental to our collective and individual ability as humans to think, emote, interact with each other, earn a living and enjoy life. On this basis, the promotion, protection and restoration of mental health can be regarded as a vital concern of individuals, communities and societies throughout the world. Multiple social, psychological, and biological factors determine the level of mental health of a person at any point of time. For example, violence and persistent socio-economic pressures are recognized risks to mental health. The clearest evidence is associated with sexual violence. Poor mental health is also associated with rapid social change, stressful work conditions, gender discrimination, social exclusion, unhealthy lifestyle, physical ill-health and human rights violations. There are specific psychological and personality factors that make people vulnerable to mental health problems. Biological risks include genetic factors. Mental health promotion involves actions that improve psychological well-being.\\xa0 This may involve creating an environment that supports mental health.  An environment that respects and protects basic civil, political, socio-economic and cultural rights is fundamental to mental health. Without the security and freedom provided by these rights, it is difficult to maintain a high level of mental health. National mental health policies should be concerned both with mental disorders and, with broader issues that promote mental health. Mental health promotion should be mainstreamed into governmental and nongovernmental policies and programmes. In addition to the health sector, it is essential to involve the education, labour, justice, transport, environment, housing, and welfare sectors. Specific ways to promote mental health include: In the context of national efforts to develop and implement mental health policy, it is vital to not only protect and promote the mental well-being of its citizens, but also address the needs of persons with defined mental disorders. Knowledge of what to do about the escalating burden of mental disorders has improved substantially over the past decade. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating both the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of key interventions for priority mental disorders in countries at different levels of economic development. Examples of interventions that are cost-effective, feasible, and affordable include: A range of effective measures also exists for the prevention of suicide, prevention and treatment of mental disorders in children, prevention and treatment of dementia, and treatment of substance-use disorders. The mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) has produced evidence based guidance for non-specialists to enable them to better identify and manage a range of priority mental health conditions. WHO supports governments in the goal of strengthening and promoting mental health. WHO has evaluated evidence for promoting mental health and is working with governments to disseminate this information and to integrate effective strategies into policies and plans. In 2013, the World Health Assembly approved a \"Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan for 2013-2020\". The Plan is a commitment by all WHO’s Member States to take specific actions to improve mental health and to contribute to the attainment of a set of global targets. The Action Plan’s overall goal is to promote mental well-being, prevent mental disorders, provide care, enhance recovery, promote human rights and reduce the mortality, morbidity and disability for persons with mental disorders. It focuses on 4 key objectives to: Particular emphasis is given in the Action Plan to the protection and promotion of human rights, the strengthening and empowering of civil society and to the central place of community-based care. In order to achieve its objectives, the Action Plan proposes and requires clear actions for governments, international partners and for WHO. Ministries of Health will need to take a leadership role, and WHO will work with them and with international and national partners, including civil society, to implement the plan. As there is no action that fits all countries, each government will need to adapt the Action Plan to its specific national circumstances.

The data presented here are from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). For inclusion in NSDUH prevalence estimates, mental illnesses include those that are diagnosable currently or within the past year; of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria specified within the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV); and, exclude developmental and substance use disorders. *All other groups are non-Hispanic or Latino | **NH/OPI = Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander ***AI/AN = American Indian / Alaskan Native *All other groups are non-Hispanic or Latino *All other groups are non-Hispanic or Latino | **NH/OPI = Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander ***AI/AN = American Indian / Alaskan Native *All other groups are non-Hispanic or Latino Diagnostic Assessment: Population: Survey Non-response: Please see the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health Methodological Summary and Definitions report for further information on how these data were collected and calculated.

This study aimed to determine economic factors influencing\\nmental health using multiple regression models in Ilam province in 2013.\\n \\nMethods: In this cross sectional study, 903 families from different cities of Ilam were selected using\\nmultistage cluster sampling. The families were selected from each city separately and each head\\nof family was interviewed. The instruments for data collection included general and economic questionnaires\\nand the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The data were analyzed using SPSS software\\nversion 21, Eviews, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation coefficient, single and multiple linear\\nregressions.\\n \\nResults: The mean ± SD mental health score in this study was 28.5±12.10. The mental health increased\\nfor 4.26 units per each unit of life satisfaction increase, decreased for 4.09 units per each unit\\nof gender growth, increased for 2.94 units per each unit of increase in economic status and had a significant\\ncorrelation with all the three components (p<0.001).\\n \\nConclusion: In order to improve people's mental health, it is recommended that healthcare officials\\nmay more attention to this matter through implementation of programs such as life skills’ training,\\nstress resistance skills training, and helping individuals to be able to adapt themselves to their life\\nenvironment.\\n \\nMental health has a wide criteria-based range such as ideological, cultural, traditional, economic and geographical conditions (1). The WHO defines mental health as the “ability to have harmonious relationships with others, change and reform the social and individual environment, resolve contradictions and personal tendencies logically, fairly and properly”. Therefore, mental health refers to the possibility for individual and social development of mental healthiness through the prevention of mental disorders, appropriate treatment and rehabilitation (2). Overall, mental health plays key roles in ensuring the efficacy of every society (3,4).\\n \\nMental disorder is one of the most important and significant diseases of which is predicted to increase its portion of the total percentage of diseases for 50% from 10.5% to 15% until 2020 (5). According to studies in Europe and America, between 9% to 16% of females and 5% to 12% of males have a potential depressive disorder during their lifetime and about 4.5% to 9.3% of females and 2.3% to 3.2% of males suffer from related disorders in a period of time throughout their lives (6). Dibaj's study on the mental health conditions of the students indicated that 31.6% of the students were suspected of mental disorders (7). According to the study conducted in England on the socioeconomic conditions and prevalent mental disorders using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), it was found that economic problems have a relationship with prevalent mental disorders in both males and females (8).\\n \\nMental diseases impose a wide range of costs on family members, employers, and the whole society (9). According to the WHO, mental disorders account for 3-4% of gross domestic product (GDP) of countries annually (10). Today, 450 million people in the world are suffering from mental or behavioral disorders (1). According to recent studies in Iran, 21% of the whole population (25.9% of females and 14.6% of males) are also suffering from certain types of mental disorders (11). Poverty, wrong immigration, and living on the fringes of cities are the main factors underlying serious mental health problems and are unfortunately rising in developing countries. Despite having lots of the problems mentioned, the population living on the fringes of cities receive minimum attention in terms of mental health policies (12). Mental inequality can be ascribed to two types of factors: A) flexible and modifiable factors (avoidable inequality), B) inflexible and non-modifiable factors (unavoidable inequality). Socioeconomic conditions, gender, education, social involvement level, occupation, housing quality and ownership can be cited as modifiable factors; and age, gender, nationality and race can be cited as non-modifiable factors. Avoidable inequality is not only a kind of inequality, but also a kind of injustice, as it is human-made and is removable through existing knowledge. If the cause of mental health inequality in a society is discovered, essential policies and strategies will be determined. Therefore, more efficient measures will be taken to improve justice concerning mental health in that society (13).\\n \\nWhile physical health is highly regarded in hospitals and health centers, the dependence of physical health on mental health is neglected. The prevalence of mental disorders increased the need for mental healthcare services, and relative deprivation of the people living in villages and small cities from these services emphasize the significance of this study. It is clear that resolving such problems demands the identification of individual and socioeconomic factors. As a result, necessary actions should be taken in order to prevent mental disorders and have healthier generations in the future. Therefore, this study was conducted in Ilam in 2013 to investigate the economic factors influencing mental health using the multiple regression models.\\n \\nIn this cross sectional study, 903 families from different cities of Ilam were selected using multistage cluster sampling. The families were selected from each city separately and each head of family was interviewed. The families' general and economic status was determined using a researcher-made questionnaire consisting of demographic questions (i.e. job status, income, and living expense) which was designed and rated based on Likert scale. The standard General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used to determine the participants' general health. This questionnaire is a test with multiple and self-executing nature designed to investigate non-mental disorders found among the existing social states over the month before. In this study, a short questionnaire including 28 questions was used. This questionnaire consisted of 4 subtests. Questions 1-7 were designed to measure physical signs, 8-14 to measure anxiety and sleeplessness, 15-21 to measure social dysfunction, and 22-28 to measure depression. The questions were multiple items and there were two scoring methods. The first method was the Traditional Baymedal method in which the choices are measured based on 0-0, 1-1 and the individual's score ranges from 0 to 28. In the second method, the answers were measured based on Likert (0,1,2,3) in which the individual's score ranges from 0 to 84. The cut-off point obtained for this questionnaire in several studies in Iran is between 21 and 23 (14). In this study, the cut-off point of 23 was used. As a result, the total score between 0 and 23 was considered as desired mental health, and the total number of 24 and above as inappropriate mental health. The reliability of this questionnaire has been proven in different studies (15-18). The Cronbach's alpha was used to determine the reliability of the test which was 0.93 for all the questions.\\n \\nThe data were analyzed using SPSS software version 21, Eviews, t-test, ANOVA test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, single and multiple linear regressions.\\n \\nIn this study, 903 people from Ilam were investigated with a mean ± SD age of 32.7 ±9.45 years (range of 17-78 years). The mental health mean ± SD score for the participants under investigation was 28.5±12.10; it was 26.5±11.82 for males and 29.8±12.18 for females. Gender had a statistically significant relationship with mental health (p<0.001) and 4 subtests mental health (physical symptoms (p<0.001), anxiety and social dysfunction (p=0.034), and Depression (p=0.015), Table 1).\\n \\n*SignificantusingT-test\\n \\nThe highest mental health mean scores belonged to the age group older than 50 (31.3), those cost less than 500 thousand Tomans per month (31.66), those who were unemployed (30.20), those who were under diploma (32.23). According to the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), mental health had a significant relationship with monthly expenses (p=0.046), job status (p<0.001), and education (p=0.021) (Table 2).\\n \\n*Tested by ANOVA\\n \\n**The currency ofthe country the Iran\\n \\nThe findings of this study indicated that monthly income had a negative correlation with physical signs (R=- 0.06, p=0.212), anxiety (R=- 0.06, p=0.197), social dysfunction (R=- 0.1, p=0.027), and depression (R=- 0.08, p=0.070), and a direct correlation with mental health (R=0.1, p=0.039), while it only had a statistically significant relationship with social dysfunction (p=0.027) and mental health (p=0.039) (Table 3).\\n \\n* Significant at a level of less than 0.05\\n \\n** Significant at a level of less than 0.01\\n \\nSix variables were entered into the Multiple Regression Model in order to find the variable which was more related to mental health than the others. After eliminating the confounding variables, life satisfaction component was tested. Based on the obtained amount of Adjusted Coefficient of Determination (R2 adjusted) from this model, 12% of mental health changes were related to life satisfaction and there was a statistically significant relationship between the two variables (p<0.001) (Table 4).\\n \\nIn the second multiple regression model, the relationship between mental health and economic status and gender was investigated. Based on the obtained amount of R2 adjusted from the model, 8% of mental health changes were related to economic status and 6% were related to gender. There was also a significant statistical relationship between mental health and both components (p< 0.001) (Table 4).\\n \\nIn the third multiple regression model, the relationship between mental health and 4 subtests of mental health was investigated. There was a significant statistical relationship between mental health and all the 4 subtests (p< 0.001) (Table 5).\\n \\nAttention to physical, mental, social, and cultural health status in a society and forming the basis for the fulfillment of a healthy and dynamic lifestyle guarantees the healthiness of that society for the future. Prevention of affective disorders, anxiety and depression is most required in achieving such an invaluable goal (19). The mean score for mental health of the participants under investigation was 28.48±12.1; it was 26.46±11.82 for males and 29.84±12.18 for females. Gender had a statistically significant relationship with mental health and 4 subtests of mental health. The findings of the studies by Saberian et al (20) and Manzoori et al (21) also indicated that males were healthier than females in terms of mental health. This can be due to societal structures and social roles of males in a society. Since the society provided males with more power and opportunity than females, they enjoyed a sense of efficacy that may lead to higher mental healthiness.\\n \\nThe results of this study indicated that monthly income had an negative correlation with physical signs, anxiety, social dysfunction and depression, and a direct correlation with mental health, while it only had a significant relationship with social dysfunction (p<0.05) and mental health (p<0.05). In the studies by Love & et al (22), and Sadeghi et al in Iran (23), there was also a positive and significant correlation between income and mental health in a way that families with high income had better mental health. It seems that low income deprives some people of using healthcare services. This may evidently affect peoples' mental health.\\n \\nIn the present study, there was a significant statistical relationship between mental health and life satisfaction based on simple regression. For each unit of increase in life satisfaction, mental health would increase for 4.26 units. In the study by Mohammadbeigi et al (24), there was a significant relationship between mental health status and life satisfaction in a way that for each unit of increase in life satisfaction, mental health would increase for 2.58 units. Life satisfaction was a supporting factor against mental disorder symptoms in the present study. Such a fact was also obtained in the study conducted by Bairam et al (25) in Turkey.\\n \\nIn the present study, mental health had a significant relationship with economic status and gender based on multiple regression (p<0.05) in a way that the mental health would decrease for 4.09 units for each unit of increase in the gender, and it would increase for 2.94 units for each unit of increase in the economic status. In a study by Mohammadbeigi et al (24), the possibility of mental disorder affliction in females was 3.96 times more than males. Such results were also seen in similar studies in Turkey (26), Nigeria (27), and Iran (28). It seems that gender is one of the most effective factors in mental disorder affliction, as the results of regression analysis emphasized this point indicating that female gender increases the chance of affliction. The aim of empirical explanation of this finding in scientific texts is to emphasize the existence of growing depression and stress factors in females. Also, it is indicated from the findings of the studies by Ghasemi et al (29) that there was a significant relationship between mental health and economic factors in the participants under investigation in a way that individuals with weak economic status gained the highest score in mental health. Such results were obtained from several other similar studies (30,31). Living with weak economic status has negative effects on families' health and welfare. The fixed income-health tilt is proven in the whole world, i.e. peoples' health is affected by decreases in socioeconomic conditions.\\n \\nGiven the fact that the participants of the present study had a high general health mean score and their health status was almost worrying, it is recommended that healthcare officials pay more careful attention to this issue than ever through the implementation of programs such as life skills training, stress resistance skills training, and helping individuals to be able to adapt themselves to their life environment in order to promote mental health.\\n \\nWe wish to sincerely thank the Center for Prevention Mental-social Damages of Ilam province, Research and Technology Deputy of Ilam University of Medical Sciences, and all the heads of families whose full cooperation we enjoyed during this study.\\n \\nCite this article as: Behzadifar M, Behzadifar M, Sayehmiri A, Behzadifar M, Sarokhani M, Sayehmiri K.

Get the latest public health information from CDC: https://www.coronavirus.govGet the latest research information from NIH: https://www.nih.gov/coronavirusGet the latest shareable resources on coping with COVID-19 from NIMH: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/covid19 Menu  Mental disorders are health conditions that affect how a person thinks, feels, and acts. These disorders can impact a person’s life in significant ways, including how they cope with life events, earn a living, and relate to others. “Why did this happen?” That is a common question that patients and their families have following a psychotic episode, a suicide attempt, or the diagnosis of a mental disorder. Research conducted and funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has found that many mental disorders are caused by a combination of biological, environmental, psychological, and genetic factors. In fact, a growing body of research has found that certain genes and gene variations are associated with mental disorders. So, what is the best way to “look at your genes” and determine your personal risk? Your family health history may be one of your best clues for determining your risk of developing a mental disorder and many other common illnesses. Certain mental disorders tend to run in families, and having a close relative with a mental disorder could mean you are at a higher risk. If a family member has a mental disorder, it does not necessarily mean you will develop one. Many other factors also play a role. But knowing your family’s mental health history can help you determine whether you are at a higher risk for certain disorders, help your doctor to recommend actions for reducing your risk, and enable both you and your doctor to look for early warning signs. To gain a better understanding of your family health history, it may help to talk to your blood relatives, keep a record of your family history, talk with a mental health professional, or visit a genetic counselor. The first step in creating a family health history is to talk to your blood relatives. The most helpful information comes from “first-degree” relatives—parents, brothers, sisters, and children. Information from “second-degree” relatives—such as nieces, nephews, half-brothers, half-sisters, grandparents, aunts, and uncles—also can be helpful. Don\\'t worry if you cannot get complete information on every relative. Some people may not want to talk. Others may be unable to remember information accurately. That’s okay. Whatever information you can collect will be helpful. Free print and online tools can help you create a family health history. One tool, created by the U.S. Surgeon General, is \"My Family Health Portrait\". It helps organize the information in your family health history. You can download and print “My Family Health Portrait” and use it to record information about your family’s health. Once you fill in the information, you can keep it for your records, share the completed form with your doctor or other health care provider, or share it with family members. As a family grows or family members are diagnosed with health conditions, new or updated information can be added. It may take a little time and effort, but this legacy can improve the health of your family for generations to come. If you have mental illness in your family, you may want to consult with a mental health professional who can help you understand risk factors and preventive factors. Asking questions and providing information to your health care provider can improve your care. Talking with your doctor can build trust and may lead to better results, safety, and satisfaction. For tips and information about speaking with your doctor, visit the NIMH Taking Control of Your Mental Health webpage and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality webpage for patients and consumers. Genetic counseling can give you information about how genetic conditions might affect you or your family. The genetic counselor or other health care professional will collect your personal and family health history. They can use this information to determine how likely it is that you or a family member has a genetic condition. Based on this information, the genetic counselor can help you decide whether a genetic test might be right for you or your relative. Genetic testing often is done before or during pregnancy and soon after the birth of children, or if your doctor suspects you may have a rare disease for which specific genes are known to be the cause. To learn more about genetic counseling, visit the Genetic Counseling FAQ page of the National Human Genome Research Institute website and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Genetic Counseling webpage.  Genes are segments of DNA found in almost every cell and are passed down from parents to children. Some diseases are caused by genetic mutation(s) or by a permanent change in one or more specific genes. In other diseases, including many mental disorders, gene variants play a role in increasing or decreasing a person’s risk of developing a disease or condition. Research is advancing our understanding of the role of genetics in mental health. Although there are common genetic variants associated with rare disorders, no gene variant can predict with certainty that a person will develop a mental disorder. In many cases, even the most well-researched genetic variant may contribute to a person’s risk only by very small amounts. Knowing that you have one of these gene variants won’t tell you nearly as much about your risk as your family history can. For more information, visit the website of the National Human Genome Research Institute. Doctors order clinical or diagnostic genetic testing for people they think are at high risk of one of the rare diseases for which specific genes are known to be the cause. In clinical or diagnostic testing, doctors search for a single gene or a few genes that research has strongly associated with a specific disease. The results enable patients and their doctors to make informed health care decisions together. There are many different types of genetic tests. Genetic tests may help to: If a disease runs in your family, your health care professional can tell you if it’s the kind of illness that can be detected through genetic testing. Your health care professional can help you make decisions about whether to be tested and can help you understand test results and their implications. Direct-to-consumer genome scans are different from clinical or diagnostic genetic testing. For a fee, anyone can mail a saliva sample to companies that sell the scan—without a prescription or a health care provider’s advice. Advertisements say that the company then can provide information, based on gene variations, about a person’s risks of developing specific diseases. You can learn about the various types of genetic tests and genetic counseling by visiting the National Human Genome Research Institute website. The short answer to this question is no. Currently, genetic tests cannot accurately predict your risk of developing a mental disorder. Although research is underway, scientists don’t yet know all the gene variations that contribute to mental disorders, and those that are known, so far, raise the risk by very small amounts. One day, genetic research may make it possible to provide a more complete picture of a person’s risk of getting a particular mental disorder or to diagnose it, based on his or her genes. Although recent studies have begun to identify the genetic markers associated with certain mental disorders and eventually may lead to better screening and more personalized treatment, it is still too early to use genetic tests or genome scans to diagnose or treat mental disorders accurately.  NIMH, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), funds and conducts research to help answer important scientific questions about mental illnesses. Through research, NIMH works to determine what is promising, what helps and why, what doesn’t work, and what is safe. For example, the Genomics Research Branch in the NIMH Division of Neuroscience and Basic Behavioral Science and the Human Genetics Branch in the NIMH Intramural Research Program are currently studying and supporting research on the human genetic variations that contribute to the risk for mood and anxiety disorders, such as bipolar disorder and panic disorder, so that better ways to diagnose and treat these disorders can be developed. Research investigating these topics will help the field take steps toward better screening and personalized treatment. You can learn more about ongoing research efforts by visiting the NIMH website (search term: Genetics).

Although individuals may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future. Researchers at NIMH and around the country conduct clinical trials with patients and healthy volunteers. Talk to your health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you. For more information, visit NIMH’s Clinical Trials webpage.

It’s essential to be treated for both disorders. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are closely related to anxiety disorders, which some may experience at the same time, along with depression. Read on to learn more about the co-occurrence of anxiety and these disorders: Children \\nAnxiety disorders affect 25.1% of children between 13 and 18 years old. Research shows that untreated children with anxiety disorders are at higher risk to perform poorly in school, miss out on important social experiences, and engage in substance abuse. Anxiety disorders also often co-occur with other disorders such as depression, eating disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Older Adults\\nAnxiety is as common among older adults as among the young. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder among older adults, though anxiety disorders in this population are frequently associated with traumatic events such as a fall or acute illness. Read the best way to treat anxiety disorders in older adults. Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Almost 75% of people with mental disorders remain untreated in developing countries with almost 1 million people taking their lives each year. In addition, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1 in 13 globally suffers from anxiety. The WHO reports that anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders worldwide with specific phobia, major depressive disorder and social phobia being the most common anxiety disorders.2 Anxiety disorders are treatable, and the vast majority of people with an anxiety disorder can be helped with professional care.

It can alert us to dangers and help us prepare and pay attention. Anxiety disorders differ from normal feelings of nervousness or anxiousness, and involve excessive fear or anxiety. Anxiety disorders are the most common of mental disorders and affect nearly 30 percent of adults at some point in their lives. . But anxiety disorders are treatable and a number of effective treatments are available. Treatment helps most people lead normal productive lives. In any given year the estimated percent of U.S. adults with various anxiety disorders are: Women are more likely than men to experience anxiety disorders. Anxiety refers to anticipation of a future concern and is more associated with muscle tension and avoidance behavior. Fear is an emotional response to an immediate threat and is more associated with a fight or flight reaction – either staying to fight or leaving to escape danger. Anxiety disorders can cause people into try to avoid situations that trigger or worsen their symptoms. Job performance, school work and personal relationships can be affected. In general, for a person to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, the fear or anxiety must: There are several types of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobias, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder and separation anxiety disorder. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Generalized anxiety disorder involves persistent and excessive worry that interferes with daily activities. This ongoing worry and tension may be accompanied by physical symptoms, such as restlessness, feeling on edge or easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, muscle tension or problems sleeping. Often the worries focus on everyday things such as job responsibilities, family health or minor matters such as chores, car repairs, or appointments. Panic Disorder The core symptom of panic disorder is recurrent panic attacks, an overwhelming combination of physical and psychological distress. During an attack several of these symptoms occur in combination: Because symptoms are so severe, many people who experience a panic attack may believe they are having a heart attack or other life-threatening illness and may go to a hospital ER. Panic attacks may be expected, such as a response to a feared object, or unexpected, apparently occurring for no reason. The mean age for onset of panic disorder is 22-23. Panic attacks may occur with other mental disorders such as depression or PTSD. Phobias, Specific Phobia A specific phobia is excessive and persistent fear of a specific object, situation or activity that is generally not harmful. Patients know their fear is excessive, but they can’t overcome it. These fears cause such distress that some people go to extreme lengths to avoid what they fear. Examples are fear of flying or fear of spiders. Agoraphobia Agoraphobia is the fear of being in situations where escape may be difficult or embarrassing, or help might not be available in the event of panic symptoms. The fear is out of proportion to the actual situation and lasts generally six months or more and causes problems in functioning. A person with agoraphobia experiences this fear in two or more of the following situations: The individual actively avoids the situation, requires a companion or endures with intense fear or anxiety. Untreated agoraphobia can become so serious that a person may be unable to leave the house. A person can only be diagnosed with agoraphobia if the fear is intensely upsetting, or if it significantly interferes with normal daily activities. Social Anxiety Disorder (previously called social phobia) A person with social anxiety disorder has significant anxiety and discomfort about being embarrassed, humiliated, rejected or looked down on in social interactions. People with this disorder will try to avoid the situation or endure it with great anxiety. Common examples are extreme fear of public speaking, meeting new people or eating/drinking in public. The fear or anxiety causes problems with daily functioning and lasts at least six months. Separation Anxiety Disorder A person with separation anxiety disorder is excessively fearful or anxious about separation from those with whom he or she is attached. The feeling is beyond what is appropriate for the person’s age, persists (at least four weeks in children and six months in adults) and causes problems functioning. A person with separation anxiety disorder may be persistently worried about losing the person closest to him or her, may be reluctant or refuse to go out or sleep away from home or without that person, or may experience nightmares about separation. Physical symptoms of distress often develop in childhood, but symptoms can carry though adulthood. The causes of anxiety disorders are currently unknown but likely involve a combination of factors including genetic, environmental, psychological and developmental. Anxiety disorders can run in families, suggesting that a combination of genes and environmental stresses can produce the disorders. The first step is to see your doctor to make sure there is no physical problem causing the symptoms. If an anxiety disorder is diagnosed, a mental health professional can work with you on the best treatment. Unfortunately, many people with anxiety disorders don’t seek help. They don’t realize that they have an illness that has effective treatments. Although each anxiety disorder has unique characteristics, most respond well to two types of treatment: psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” and medications. These treatments can be given alone or in combination. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), a type of talk therapy, can help a person learn a different way of thinking, reacting and behaving to help feel less anxious. Medications will not cure anxiety disorders, but can give significant relief from symptoms. The most commonly used medications are anti-anxiety medications (generally prescribed only for a short period of time) and antidepressants. Beta-blockers, used for heart conditions, are sometimes used to control physical symptoms of anxiety. Self-Help, Coping, and Managing There are a number of things people do to help cope with symptoms of anxiety disorders and make treatment more effective. Stress management techniques and meditation can be helpful. Support groups (in-person or online) can provide an opportunity to share experiences and coping strategies. Learning more about the specifics of a disorder and helping family and friends to understand better can also be helpful. Avoid caffeine, which can worsen symptoms, and check with your doctor about any medications. Physician Review By: Ranna Parekh, M.D., M.P.H.

Get the latest public health information from CDC: https://www.coronavirus.govGet the latest research information from NIH: https://www.nih.gov/coronavirusGet the latest shareable resources on coping with COVID-19 from NIMH: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/covid19 Menu  Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. There are three types of bipolar disorder. All three types involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. These moods range from periods of extremely “up,” elated, irritable, or energized behavior (known as manic episodes) to very “down,” sad, indifferent, or hopeless periods (known as depressive episodes). Less severe manic periods are known as hypomanic episodes. Sometimes a person might experience symptoms of bipolar disorder that do not match the three categories listed above, which is referred to as “other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders.” Bipolar disorder is typically diagnosed during late adolescence (teen years) or early adulthood. Occasionally, bipolar symptoms can appear in children. Bipolar disorder can also first appear during a woman’s pregnancy or following childbirth. Although the symptoms may vary over time, bipolar disorder usually requires lifelong treatment. Following a prescribed treatment plan can help people manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. People with bipolar disorder experience periods of unusually intense emotion, changes in sleep patterns and activity levels, and uncharacteristic behaviors—often without recognizing their likely harmful or undesirable effects. These distinct periods are called “mood episodes.” Mood episodes are very different from the moods and behaviors that are typical for the person. During an episode, the symptoms last every day for most of the day. Episodes may also last for longer periods, such as several days or weeks. People having a manic episode may: People having a depressive episode may: Feel very “up,” “high,” elated, or irritable or touchy Feel very sad, “down,” empty, worried, or hopeless Feel “jumpy” or “wired” Feel slowed down or restless Have a decreased need for sleep Have trouble falling asleep, wake up too early, or sleep too much Have a loss of appetite Experience increased appetite and weight gain Talk very fast about a lot of different things Talk very slowly, feel like they have nothing to say, forget a lot Feel like their thoughts are racing Have trouble concentrating or making decisions Think they can do a lot of things at once Feel unable to do even simple things Do risky things that show poor judgment, such as eat and drink excessively, spend or give away a lot of money, or have reckless sex Have little interest in almost all activities, a decreased or absent sex drive, or an inability to experience pleasure (“anhedonia”) Feel like they are unusually important, talented, or powerful Feel hopeless or worthless, think about death or suicide Sometimes people experience both manic and depressive symptoms in the same episode. This kind of episode is called an episode with mixed features. People experiencing an episode with mixed features may feel very sad, empty, or hopeless, while, at the same, time feeling extremely energized. A person may have bipolar disorder even if their symptoms are less extreme. For example, some people with bipolar disorder (Bipolar II) experience hypomania, a less severe form of mania. During a hypomanic episode, a person may feel very good, be able to get things done, and keep up with day-to-day life. The person may not feel that anything is wrong, but family and friends may recognize the changes in mood or activity levels as possible bipolar disorder. Without proper treatment, people with hypomania can develop severe mania or depression. Proper diagnosis and treatment can help people with bipolar disorder lead healthy and active lives. Talking with a doctor or other licensed health care provider is the first step. The health care provider can complete a physical exam and order necessary medical tests to rule out other conditions. The health care provider may then conduct a mental health evaluation or provide a referral to a trained mental health care provider, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker who has experience in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. Mental health care providers usually diagnose bipolar disorder based on a person’s symptoms, lifetime history, experiences, and, in some cases, family history. Accurate diagnosis in youth is particularly important. You can find tips for talking with your health care provider in the NIMH fact sheet on\\xa0Taking Control of Your Mental Health: Tips for Talking with Your Health Care Provider. Note for Health Care Providers:\\xa0People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when they are experiencing mania or hypomania. Taking a careful medical history is essential to ensure that bipolar disorder is not mistaken for major depression. This is especially important when treating an initial episode of depression as antidepressant medications can trigger a manic episode in people who have an increased chance of having bipolar disorder. Some bipolar disorder symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses, which can make it challenging for a health care provider to make a diagnosis. In addition, many people may have bipolar disorder along with another mental disorder or condition, such as an anxiety disorder, substance use disorder, or an eating disorder. People with bipolar disorder have an increased chance of having thyroid disease, migraine headaches, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and other physical illnesses. Psychosis: Sometimes, a person with severe episodes of mania or depression may experience psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions. The psychotic symptoms tend to match the person’s extreme mood. For example: As a result, people with bipolar disorder who also have psychotic symptoms are sometimes incorrectly diagnosed with schizophrenia. When people have symptoms of bipolar disorder and also experience periods of psychosis that are separate from mood episodes, the appropriate diagnosis may be schizoaffective disorder. Anxiety: It is common for people with bipolar disorder to also have an anxiety disorder. Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): It is common for people with bipolar disorder to also have ADHD. Misuse of Drugs or Alcohol: People with bipolar disorder may misuse alcohol or drugs and engage in other high-risk behaviors at times of impaired judgment during manic episodes. Although the negative effects of alcohol use or drug use may be most evident to family, friends, and health care providers, it is important to recognize the presence of an associated mental disorder. Eating Disorders: In some cases, people with bipolar disorder also have an eating disorder, such as binge eating or bulimia. Researchers are studying the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most agree that there is no single cause and it is likely that many factors contribute to a person’s chance of having the illness. Brain Structure and Functioning: Some studies indicate that the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of people who do not have bipolar disorder or any other mental disorder. Learning more about these differences may help scientists understand bipolar disorder and determine which treatments will work best. At this time, health care providers base the diagnosis and treatment plan on a person’s symptoms and history, rather than brain imaging or other diagnostic tests. Genetics: Some research suggests that people with certain genes are more likely to develop bipolar disorder. Research also shows that people who have a parent or sibling with bipolar disorder have an increased chance of having the disorder themselves. Many genes are involved, and no one gene can cause the disorder. Learning more about how genes play a role in bipolar disorder may help researchers develop new treatments. Treatment can help many people, including those with the most severe forms of bipolar disorder. An effective treatment plan usually includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy, also called “talk therapy.” Bipolar disorder is a lifelong illness. Episodes of mania and depression typically come back over time. Between episodes, many people with bipolar disorder are free of mood changes, but some people may have lingering symptoms. Long-term, continuous treatment can help people manage these symptoms. Certain medications can help manage symptoms of bipolar disorder. Some people may need to try several different medications and work with their health care provider before finding medications that work best. Medications generally used to treat bipolar disorder include mood stabilizers and second-generation (“atypical”) antipsychotics. Treatment plans may also include medications that target sleep or anxiety. Health care providers often prescribe antidepressant medication to treat depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, combining the antidepressant with a mood stabilizer to prevent triggering a manic episode. People taking medication should: Avoid stopping a medication without talking to a health care provider first. Suddenly stopping a medication may lead to a “rebound” or worsening of bipolar disorder symptoms. For basic information about medications, visit NIMH’s Mental Health Medications webpage. For the most up-to-date information on medications, side effects, and warnings, visit the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Medication Guides website. Psychotherapy, also called “talk therapy,” can be an effective part of the treatment plan for people with bipolar disorder. Psychotherapy is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help a person identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It can provide support, education, and guidance to people with bipolar disorder and their families. Treatment may include therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychoeducation, which are used to treat a variety of conditions. Treatment may also include newer therapies designed specifically for the treatment of bipolar disorder, including interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) and family-focused therapy. Determining whether intensive psychotherapeutic intervention at the earliest stages of bipolar disorder can prevent or limit its full-blown onset is an important area of ongoing research. Visit NIMH’s Psychotherapies webpage to learn about the various types of psychotherapies. Some people may find other treatments helpful in managing their bipolar symptoms, including: Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT): ECT is a brain stimulation procedure that can help people get relief from severe symptoms of bipolar disorder. With modern ECT, a person usually goes through a series of treatment sessions over several weeks. ECT is delivered under general anesthesia and is safe. It can be effective in treating severe depressive and manic episodes, which occur most often when medication and psychotherapy are not effective or are not safe for a particular patient. ECT can also be effective when a rapid response is needed, as in the case of suicide risk or catatonia (a state of unresponsiveness). More research is needed to determine the effects of other treatments, including: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): TMS is a newer approach to brain stimulation that uses magnetic waves. It is delivered to an awake patient most days for 1 month. Research shows that TMS is helpful for many people with various subtypes of depression, but its role in the treatment of bipolar disorder is still under study. Supplements: Although there are reports that some supplements and herbs may help, not enough research has been conducted to fully understand how these supplements may affect people with bipolar disorder. It is important for a health care provider to know about all prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and supplements a patient is taking. Certain medications and supplements taken together may cause unwanted or dangerous effects. Regular Exercise: Regular aerobic exercise, such as jogging, brisk walking, swimming, or bicycling, helps with depression and anxiety, promotes better sleep, and is healthy for your heart and brain. There is also some evidence that anaerobic exercise such as weightlifting, yoga, and Pilates can be helpful. Check with your health care provider before you start a new exercise regimen. Keeping a Life Chart: Even with proper treatment, mood changes can occur. Treatment is more effective when a patient and health care provider work together and talk openly about concerns and choices. Keeping a life chart that records daily mood symptoms, treatments, sleep patterns, and life events can help patients and health care providers track and treat bipolar disorder over time. Patients can easily share data collected via smartphone apps – including self-reports, self- ratings, and activity data – with their health care providers and therapists. If you are in crisis: Call the toll-free National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The service is available to everyone. All calls are confidential. Contact social media outlets directly if you are concerned about a friend’s social media updates or dial 911 in an emergency. If you are thinking about harming yourself or thinking about suicide: Living with bipolar disorder can be challenging, but there are ways to help make it easier for yourself, a friend, or a loved one. Remember: Bipolar disorder is a lifelong illness, but long-term, ongoing treatment can help control symptoms and enable you to live a healthy life. Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individuals may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future. Researchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials uncovered years ago. Be part of tomorrow’s medical breakthroughs. Talk to your health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.

Top',\n"," 'Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders currently lists five types: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, other specified bipolar and related disorders, and unspecified bipolar and related disorders. In the United States, about 4.4 percent of adults experience bipolar disorder at some point. People with bipolar disorder tend to have moods marked by highs and lows, or periods of mania and depression. The duration and intensity of these episodes enable health professionals to determine which subtype of bipolar disorder a person has. The categories include: Bipolar I and II are the most common subtypes, with bipolar I being more severe in terms of manic symptoms. Symptoms of bipolar disorder include episodes of mania or hypomania and can include depression.People may also have periods during which they feel fairly stable. Symptoms vary and may change over time. Manic episodes involve extreme highs, during which a person may experience: Manic periods can affect a person’s daily life, job, and relationships. Symptoms of hypomania are similar to those of mania, but they are less severe. Nonetheless, others often notice these symptoms, which can interfere with the person’s life and relationships. According to a 2012 study in the journal American Family Physician, while bipolar disorder involves manic or hypomanic symptoms, most people with the condition experience depression the majority of the time. Depressive symptoms of bipolar disorder are the same as the symptoms of clinical depression and include: For health professionals to classify these symptoms as depression, they must last for at least 2 weeks. Bipolar I and II may cause additional symptoms, such as anxiety or psychosis. During psychotic episodes, people lose touch with reality and may experience hallucinations or delusions. People with bipolar I or II may experience what doctors call “rapid cycling.” This means that they have had at least 4 episodes in the previous year, with occasional periods of remission for at least 2 months or a shift to the opposite mood, such as from mania to depression. It can be difficult to identify symptoms in younger people because the signs can resemble regular developmental highs and lows. Patterns of symptoms in children and teenagers can also differ from those in adults. Most people with bipolar disorder receive a diagnosis in early adulthood, after symptoms have persisted for several years. A doctor or psychiatric nurse practitioner will diagnose bipolar disorder based on a person’s medical history and symptoms. They may: To rule out other causes of depressive and manic symptoms, a doctor may also perform a physical examination, blood tests, or brain scans. A healthcare provider will suggest a treatment plan based on the person’s symptoms and situation. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, so treatment aims to manage symptoms. Treatment options include: Prescribers often recommend medications for people with bipolar disorder, with many individuals taking multiple drugs. The mood stabilizer lithium is a common treatment, with some research suggesting that it can significantly help prevent long-term relapse. Other medicines for bipolar disorder include: Psychotherapy can be an important treatment component for people with bipolar disorder. It can enable them to recognize changes in thoughts and mood and respond accordingly. Therapy can also help people establish healthful routines and learn new coping skills. It may take place on a one-to-one basis, with family, or as part of a group. Most people with bipolar disorder and other mood disorders find lifestyle changes beneficial. Typical changes include: Experts do not know exactly what causes bipolar disorder, although they believe that several factors play a role. These include: Most likely, a combination of heredity and environmental factors plays a role in bipolar development. There are several types of bipolar disorder, with significant symptom overlap between them. While bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, treatments such as medications, therapy, and lifestyle modifications can effectively help people manage their symptoms. To support their mental health, it is vital for people with bipolar disorder to seek help from others and stay in regular contact with their doctors.

Depressive episodes linked to the summer can occur, but are much less common than winter episodes of SAD. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is not considered as a separate disorder. It is a type of depression displaying a recurring seasonal pattern. To be diagnosed with SAD, people must meet full criteria for major depression coinciding with specific seasons (appearing in the winter or summer months) for at least 2 years. Seasonal depressions must be much more frequent than any non-seasonal depressions. Symptoms of the Winter Pattern of SAD include: Symptoms of the less frequently occurring summer seasonal affective disorder include: Attributes that may increase your risk of SAD include: The causes of SAD are unknown, but research has found some biological clues:\\xa0 There are four major types of treatment for SAD: \\xa0These may be used alone or in combination. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to treat SAD. The FDA has also approved the use of bupropion, another type of antidepressant, for treating SAD. As with other medications, there are side effects to SSRIs. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition. You may need to try several different antidepressant medications before finding the one that improves your symptoms without causing problematic side effects. For basic information about SSRIs and other mental health medications, visit NIMH’s Medications webpage. Check the FDA’s website for the latest information on warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications. Light therapy has been a mainstay of treatment for SAD since the 1980s. The idea behind light therapy is to replace the diminished sunshine of the fall and winter months using daily exposure to bright, artificial light. Symptoms of SAD may be relieved by sitting in front of a light box first thing in the morning, on a daily basis from the early fall until spring. Most typically, light boxes filter out the ultraviolet rays and require 20-60 minutes of exposure to 10,000 lux of cool-white fluorescent light, an amount that is about 20 times greater than ordinary indoor lighting. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is type of psychotherapy that is effective for SAD. Traditional cognitive behavioral therapy has been adapted for use with SAD (CBT-SAD). CBT-SAD relies on basic techniques of CBT such as identifying negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive thoughts along with a technique called behavioral activation. Behavioral activation seeks to help the person identify activities that are engaging and pleasurable, whether indoors or outdoors, to improve coping with winter. At present, vitamin D supplementation by itself is not regarded as an effective SAD treatment. The reason behind its use is that low blood levels of vitamin D were found in people with SAD. The low levels are usually due to insufficient dietary intake or insufficient exposure to sunshine. However, the evidence for its use has been mixed. While some studies suggest vitamin D supplementation may be as effective as light therapy, others found vitamin D had no effect. Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions, including seasonal affective disorder. During clinical trials, treatments might be new drugs or new combinations of drugs, new psychotherapies or devices, or new ways to use existing treatments. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individual participants may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future. Please Note: Decisions about whether to apply for a clinical trial and which ones are best suited for a given individual are best made in collaboration with your licensed health professional. Scientists at the NIMH campus conduct research on numerous areas of study, including cognition, genetics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. The studies take place at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland and usually require regular visits.

Top\",\n"," \"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is now more commonly known as major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern. It is a type of depression that tends to affect people who live in countries farther from the equator. It is most common during the winter months and tends to resolve in springtime. Other names for major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern include SAD, winter depression, and seasonal depression. According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the condition affects about 5% of people in the United States. Symptoms can last for approximately 40% of the year. In this article, we look at how this condition develops, who might be at risk, and the available treatment options. People with SAD, or major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, experience symptoms of depression with gradually increasing frequency as days start getting shorter. These symptoms slowly improve in early spring, as the amount of sunlight increases. The APA suggest that this condition might occur when reduced exposure to sunlight triggers a chemical imbalance in the brain. However, more research is necessary to confirm the cause. Seasonal changes in sunlight affect the circadian rhythms that regulate a person’s sense of time. Some people consider this to be their “internal biological clock,” and disruption to the circadian rhythm can significantly disrupt mood. According to Harvard Medical School, women experience SAD more often than men. SAD also develops in young people more often than in older adults. It is also more common in people who live farther north of the equator, as winter further reduces the hours of daylight in these locations. Less commonly, some people experience SAD during the summer months. The symptoms of SAD are similar to those of depression. The major difference is that symptoms develop as winter approaches and resolve during springtime. Most people’s symptoms occur and resolve at the same time every year. Symptoms are usually mild as autumn advances and the hours of daylight start to decline. The severity, characteristics, and patterns of SAD can vary considerably from person to person. The signs and symptoms of SAD tend to include: A doctor may not diagnose this condition in people who experience SAD as an effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors. For instance, people who work seasonally may not have employment during the winter, and they may exhibit some symptoms of depression as a result. Some people experience these symptoms during the summer rather than the winter, with symptoms resolving during the wintertime. However, the most common presentation of SAD occurs during the winter months.  Certain factors can affect a person’s risk of developing SAD. We discuss these in more detail below: Women are more likely than men to experience SAD, though this may be due to the higher prevalence of overall depression among women. According to a 2015 overview in the journal Depression Research and Treatment, diagnoses of SAD are four times more common in women than men. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) suggest that living farther from the equator can increase the risk of developing SAD. People who live in places where the days are much shorter in winter are more susceptible. Having close relatives with a history of other types of depression can increase the likelihood that SAD may develop. People with a history of depression or bipolar disorder, as well as those who currently have either of these conditions, are more likely to develop SAD. However, a doctor will only reach a diagnosis of SAD if depression symptoms become more common during a particular season each year. Experts are still unsure of the exact causes of SAD. However, studies have pointed to the following factors: Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in moderating mood. It binds to a particular protein to travel around the body. Levels of this protein usually drop during the winter months to protect a person against the environmental stress of the season. However, one 2016 longitudinal study in the journal Brain found that people with SAD do not experience a decrease in serotonin transporter levels during winter. The risk is especially high in people who are prone to affective disorders. Melatonin is a hormone that influences sleep patterns and mood. The NIMH maintain that reduced exposure to sunlight during winter’s shorter days disrupts the balance of melatonin in the body. A 2018 study in rats, the results of which appear in the journal Genes & Nutrition, found links between vitamin D and serotonin that could explain the onset of depression in some people. The body produces vitamin D after exposure to sunlight. Getting less sunlight during the winter months might explain the cycle of depressive symptoms that characterize SAD. The doctor may ask the following questions to identify whether or not SAD is present: Because there are several types of depression, it might take some time for a doctor to diagnose SAD accurately. No medical or laboratory test is available for diagnosing this condition. However, the doctor may order some diagnostic tests, including blood tests, to rule out other illnesses or underlying conditions. The APA do not class SAD as a separate disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). Instead, SAD is a “course specifier.” A healthcare professional will only diagnose SAD if a person has symptoms of major depressive disorder that develop and resolve at specific times each year. According to the APA, a person may be able to alleviate SAD symptoms by increasing their exposure to sunlight. For example, going for long walks when there is still some sunlight could help. Treating SAD usually involves medication, therapy, and lightbox therapy. Lifestyle adjustments can also help reduce the impact of SAD. Although SAD seems to occur due to changes in brain chemistry, therapy that focuses on mood and behavior can also help. The APA suggest that this type of therapy may have a longer lasting benefit than taking medications or using a lightbox to manage mood. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help people monitor and control their reactions to certain situations and environments more successfully. If a person can alter the way they perceive events, their behavior will also change with time. This may help reduce the severity of their symptoms during the season in which the effects of SAD peak. A course of CBT usually includes an individual program of thought and breathing exercises to help a person identify and moderate negative feelings. People can attend group or partner sessions of CBT. Such sessions provide support and advice to those who live with people with SAD. A healthcare provider may prescribe an antidepressant, usually a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This type of medication increases serotonin levels. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have now approved bupropion (Wellbutrin XL) for specific use by people who have SAD. People should always follow their doctor’s instruction when taking these drugs and check the prescribing information for side effects and potential risks. In this article, learn more about antidepressants. If a person’s symptoms are severe enough to impact daily function, a doctor may recommend bright light therapy. Also known as phototherapy, this intervention can help restore a person’s circadian rhythms. In bright light therapy, a person sits in front of a specialized lightbox for a set amount of time every day between early fall and spring. Ultraviolet lamps, full spectrum lights, and tanning lamps will not have the same effect for people with SAD. The NIMH recommend engaging in lightbox exposure as soon as possible after waking up. In general, people should receive light therapy for 20–60 minutes per day, depending on the strength of the light. Some people with SAD find that increasing their exposure to natural sunlight can help alleviate symptoms. Examples include opening blinds and curtains, trimming trees around the house, and sitting closer to the window during the daytime. Getting outside every day for a long spell in the open air may help, as might staying social and active. The seasonal nature of SAD means that planning activities ahead of the season can help reduce its impact on everyday life. Similarly, maintaining regular exercise and a balanced, nutritious diet are great for overall health. They might also help a person alleviate symptoms of anxiety and support a more regular sleep cycle.  Can seasonal depression turn into a type that occurs all year round?   According to the APA, a healthcare professional must diagnose SAD, or major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, in subsequent episodes. There must be a seasonal relationship between the onset of a major depressive episode and a particular time of the year, such as fall or winter. With this in mind, symptoms can occur at any time and may persist after the symptoms of the depressive episode have improved (for instance, in the summer). However, for people whose episode began in fall or winter and did not resolve in the summer, it would be major depressive disorder. Careful recordkeeping of symptoms may help the person’s mental health provider define the type of major depressive disorder they have and suggest an appropriate treatment plan.

Get the latest public health information from CDC: https://www.coronavirus.govGet the latest research information from NIH: https://www.nih.gov/coronavirusGet the latest shareable resources on coping with COVID-19 from NIMH: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/covid19 Menu  Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality, which causes significant distress for the individual, their family members, and friends. If left untreated, the symptoms of schizophrenia can be persistent and disabling. However, effective treatments are available. When delivered in a timely, coordinated, and sustained manner, treatment can help affected individuals to engage in school or work, achieve independence, and enjoy personal relationships. Schizophrenia is typically diagnosed in the late teen years to the early thirties and tends to emerge earlier in males (late adolescence – early twenties) than females (early twenties – early thirties). A diagnosis of schizophrenia often follows the first episode of psychosis, when individuals first display symptoms of schizophrenia. Gradual changes in thinking, mood, and social functioning often begin before the first episode of psychosis, usually starting in mid-adolescence. Schizophrenia can occur in younger children, but it is rare for it to occur before late adolescence. The symptoms of schizophrenia generally fall into the following three categories: Psychotic symptoms include altered perceptions (e.g., changes in vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste), abnormal thinking, and odd behaviors. People with psychotic symptoms may lose a shared sense of reality and experience themselves and the world in a distorted way. Specifically, individuals typically experience: Negative symptoms include loss of motivation, disinterest or lack of enjoyment in daily activities, social withdrawal, difficulty showing emotions, and difficulty functioning normally. Specifically, individuals typically have: Cognitive symptoms include problems in attention, concentration, and memory. For some individuals, the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are subtle, but for others, they are more prominent and interfere with activities like following conversations, learning new things, or remembering appointments. Specifically, individuals typically experience:  Several factors contribute to the risk of developing schizophrenia. Genetics:  Schizophrenia sometimes runs in families. However, it is important to know that just because someone in a family has schizophrenia, it does not mean that other members of the family will have it as well. Genetic studies strongly suggest that many different genes increase the risk of developing schizophrenia, but that no single gene causes the disorder by itself. It is not yet possible to use genetic information to predict who will develop schizophrenia. Environment:  Scientists think that interactions between genetic risk and aspects of an individual’s environment may play a role in the development of schizophrenia. Environmental factors that may be involved include living in poverty, stressful surroundings, and exposure to viruses or nutritional problems before birth. Brain structure and function:  Scientists think that differences in brain structure, function, and interactions among chemical messengers (called neurotransmitters) may contribute to the development of schizophrenia. For example, differences in the volumes of specific components of the brain, in the way regions of the brain are connected and work together, and in neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, are found in people with schizophrenia. Differences in brain connections and brain circuits seen in people with schizophrenia may begin developing before birth. Changes to the brain that occur during puberty may trigger psychotic episodes in people who are vulnerable due to genetics, environmental exposures, or the types of brain differences mentioned above. The causes of schizophrenia are complex and are not fully understood, so current treatments focus on managing symptoms and solving problems related to day to day functioning. Treatments include: Antipsychotic medications can help reduce the intensity and frequency of psychotic symptoms. They are usually taken daily in pill or liquid forms. Some antipsychotic medications are given as injections once or twice a month, which some individuals find to be more convenient than daily oral doses. Patients whose symptoms do not improve with standard antipsychotic medication typically receive clozapine. People treated with clozapine must undergo routine blood testing to detect a potentially dangerous side effect that occurs in 1-2% of patients. Many people taking antipsychotic medications have side effects such as weight gain, dry mouth, restlessness, and drowsiness when they start taking these medications. Some of these side effects subside over time, but others may persist, which may cause some people to consider stopping their antipsychotic medication. Suddenly stopping medication can be dangerous and it can make schizophrenia symptoms worse. People should not stop taking antipsychotic medication without talking to a health care provider first. Shared decision making between doctors and patients is the recommended strategy for determining the best type of medication or medication combination and the right dose. You can find the latest information on warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website. Cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral skills training, supported employment, and cognitive remediation interventions may help address the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. A combination of these therapies and antipsychotic medication is common. Psychosocial treatments can be helpful for teaching and improving coping skills to address the everyday challenges of schizophrenia. They can help people pursue their life goals, such as attending school, working, or forming relationships. Individuals who participate in regular psychosocial treatment are less likely to relapse or be hospitalized. For more information on psychosocial treatments, see the Psychotherapies webpage on the NIMH website. Educational programs for family members, significant others, and friends offer instruction about schizophrenia symptoms and treatments, and strategies for assisting the person with the illness. Increasing key supporters’ understanding of psychotic symptoms, treatment options, and the course of recovery can lessen their distress, bolster coping and empowerment, and strengthen their capacity to offer effective assistance. Family-based services may be provided on an individual basis or through multi-family workshops and support groups. For more information about family-based services in your area, you can visit the family education and support groups page on the National Alliance on Mental Illness website. Coordinated specialty care (CSC) is a general term used to describe recovery-oriented treatment programs for people with first episode psychosis, an early stage of schizophrenia. A team of health professionals and specialists deliver CSC, which includes psychotherapy, medication management, case management, employment and education support, and family education and support. The person with early psychosis and the team work together to make treatment decisions, involving family members as much as possible. Compared to typical care for early psychosis, CSC is more effective at reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing involvement in work or school. Check here for more information about CSC programs. Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is designed especially for individuals with schizophrenia who are at risk for repeated hospitalizations or homelessness. The key elements of ACT include a multidisciplinary team, including a medication prescriber, a shared caseload among team members, direct service provision by team members, a high frequency of patient contact, low patient to staff ratios, and outreach to patients in the community. ACT reduces hospitalizations and homelessness among individuals with schizophrenia. Check here for more information about ACT programs. Caring for and supporting a loved one with schizophrenia can be very challenging. It can be difficult to know how to respond to someone who is experiencing psychosis. Some symptoms require immediate emergency care. If your loved one is thinking about harming themselves or others or attempting suicide, seek help right away: The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator for finding mental health treatment facilities and programs. SAMHSA’s Early Serious Mental Illness Treatment Locator provides information about treatment facilities that offer coordinated specialty care.

The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individuals may benefit directly from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge to help others in the future. Researchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials uncovered years ago. Be part of tomorrow’s medical breakthroughs.

Top',\n"," 'A study links the consumption of ultra-processed foods with the shortening of the body’s telomeres.  Telomeres are structures located at the ends of our chromosomes. Although they contain no genetic information themselves, they preserve the integrity of chromosomes by keeping their ends from fraying, much as shoelace tips protect the laces. Telomeres become shorter and less effective over time as chromosomes replicate. Scientists view them as markers of an individual’s biological age at a cellular level. New research indicates that eating ultra-processed foods is linked to the accelerated shortening of telomeres and cell aging. The researchers, from the University of Navarra in Pamplona, Spain, presented their findings at this year’s European and International Congress on Obesity (ECOICO 2020) in September. The findings also feature in a study paper in The Americal Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Lucia Alonso-Pedrero, who is a doctoral researcher at this university, led the study. The consumption of ultra-processed foods, or UPFs, is on the rise worldwide. UPFs are manufactured food products comprising the building blocks of naturally occurring foods: protein isolates, sugars, fats, and oils. However, while their components are often extracted from natural sources, UPFs ultimately contain no, or very little, in the way of whole foods. The companies that produce UPFs often add flavorings and emulsifiers for taste, as well as colorings and other cosmetic additives to achieve the desired appearance. UPFs are nutritionally poor and often unbalanced. UPFs are highly profitable for their producers due to their inexpensive ingredients, cost effective manufacturing processes, and long shelf life in stores. What makes them so attractive to consumers is their convenience and their relative imperishability. Previous research has not conclusively established a link between UPFs in general and telomere length (TL). However, researchers have noted associations between TL and alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages, processed meats, and foods high in saturated fat and sugar. Other research indicates a UPF connection to several serious conditions, such as obesity, hypertension, depression, metabolic syndrome, some types of cancer, and type 2 diabetes. However, these conditions also tend to be age-related and thus difficult to associate definitively with the consumption of UPFs. The NOVA system classifies foods according to the degree of processing that their production involves, as opposed to their nutritional content. The goal of Alonso-Pedrero and her colleagues was to investigate the effect of UPF consumption in older adults using NOVA as a means of categorizing the foods that they consumed. The researchers began their analysis with data from the SUN project, which the University of Navarra is conducting with other Spanish universities. The ongoing study began recruiting in 2000 and includes volunteers over the age of 20 years. Participants are required to fill out and return questionnaires every 2 years. In 2008, all SUN participants over the age of 55 years took part in a genetic study that forms the foundation of the new research. A total of 886 individuals — 645 men and 241 women — provided saliva samples for DNA analysis and self-reported their daily food consumption. Their average age was 67.7 years. The team sorted the participants into four groups of equal size, or quartiles, according to the number of UPF servings that they consumed daily: In terms of telomeres, Alonso-Pedrero and her colleagues detected a clear correspondence between TL and the consumption of UPFs. The likelihood of shortened telomeres increased dramatically with the number of UPF servings, starting with the medium-low group. That group was 29% more likely to exhibit reduced TL, while the medium-high group was 40% more likely to do so. Those in the high group were 82% more likely to have shortened telomeres. The study’s authors write: “In this cross-sectional study of elderly Spanish subjects, we showed a robust strong association between UPF consumption and TL. Further research in larger longitudinal studies with baseline and repeated measures of TL is needed to confirm these observations.” The researchers also made a number of general observations regarding those who consumed more than 3 servings of UPFs per day. People in this quartile: Individuals who ate more UPFs were less likely to adhere to a healthful Mediterranean diet. In exchange, they consumed more fats, saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats, sodium, sugar-sweetened beverages, cholesterol, fast food, and processed meats. The study authors also found that those who consumed higher amounts of UPFs were more likely to experience depression — especially when they were less active physically. Finally, the findings linked the consumption of UPFs to excessive body weight, hypertension, and all-cause mortality. This article identifies the 15 most healthful foods based on recent research.

In their latest advice, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that people with moderate-to-severe asthma may be at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19. However, a review of research by scientists at the University of Colorado in Denver has found no evidence of an increased prevalence of asthma among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with the condition’s prevalence in the wider population. In addition, they found that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had asthma were no more likely to be intubated than other patients. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. “The CDC [place] people with asthma at higher risk [of] COVID-related hospitalization,” says senior author Dr. Fernando Holguin. “However, many international studies show low numbers of [asthmatic people] among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These findings challenge the assumption about asthma as a risk factor.” In a research letter that appears in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society, the authors report:  “Despite early concern about disproportionately high morbidity and mortality for those with asthma, data presented here and elsewhere show minimal evidence of a clinically significant relationship.” For their analysis, the researchers identified 15 studies published in English before May 7, 2020, that reported on asthma prevalence among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The studies took place in Brazil, China, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. When they compared these figures with the prevalence of asthma in each population, the numbers were broadly similar. Although the prevalence of asthma among hospitalized COVID-19 patients varied widely from study to study, the overall prevalence was around 7%.  By contrast, the authors found that people with asthma accounted for more than 20% of all those hospitalized with influenza in the U.S.  Finally, they looked at whether or not patients admitted to the University of Colorado Hospital with COVID-19 were more likely to be intubated if they had asthma. After adjusting for the patients’ age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), they found no evidence that this was the case. In conclusion, they write: “While there is variable asthma prevalence among COVID-19 published studies, it appears similar to population prevalence, and certainly much lower than what would be expected during seasonal flu. The results of this study suggest that asthma does not appear to be a significant risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization or intubation.” The authors speculate that people with asthma who use inhaled corticosteroids may have fewer ACE2 receptors in the lining of their respiratory tract as a result. These are the receptors that the virus uses to enter its host’s cells. They add that people with asthma in general, and allergic asthma in particular, may have fewer ACE2 receptors. However, they write that the effect of ACE2 receptor numbers on a person’s risk of COVID-19 and disease severity remains unclear and merits further investigation. They also acknowledge that their study had some limitations. For example, the prevalence of asthma among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 varied widely between studies, which suggests that there was a lack of consistency in reporting comorbid conditions. Also, some studies did not describe how the researchers gathered data on asthma diagnoses. The authors also note that their sample size may not be large enough to draw definitive conclusions.

For example, the prevalence of asthma among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 varied widely between studies, which suggests that there was a lack of consistency in reporting comorbid conditions. Also, some studies did not describe how the researchers gathered data on asthma diagnoses. The authors also note that their sample size may not be large enough to draw definitive conclusions. They call for more research into the risk of severe COVID-19 for people with asthma. For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.

Firstly, scientists at the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, in Moscow, devised a vaccine that elicits a robust immune response, with no serious side effects in humans.  The last few weeks also saw the development of a much faster COVID-19 test and an intranasal vaccine that was effective in mice.  Finally, a meta-analysis helps settle the matter of whether blood pressure drugs make COVID-19 better or worse, while an arthritis drug may reduce severe illness. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. The Russian vaccine, known as Sputnik V, uses a modified version of an adenovirus that causes the common cold. Denis Logunov, the study’s first author and head of the research lab at Gamaleya, explains how it works. “When adenovirus vaccines enter people’s cells, they deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein genetic code, which causes cells to produce the spike protein. This helps teach the immune system to recognize and attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus,” Logunov says. The researchers assessed the vaccine in a small phase 1 and 2 trial that lasted 42 days and included 38 healthy participants aged 18–60. At this point in the study, the scientists wanted to assess the vaccine’s safety and its ability to elicit an immune response, rather than whether it can prevent infections with the new coronavirus.  The results showed a strong immune response in the participants. They developed antibodies and more advanced immune responses, similar to T cell reactions. T cells are white immune cells — some of which, called killer T cells, can find and kill infected cells.  The Russian vaccine was also found to be safe and did not elicit any serious side effects. Next, the team plans to enter phase 3 of the trial, which will involve 40,000 participants.  Japanese-based scientists from Osaka University and Osaka Habikino Medical Center believe they could repurpose an arthritis drug to treat severe COVID-19.  The team began their research by focusing on cytokines, proteins secreted by immune cells, with key immunomodulatory functions. They aimed to understand their role in cytokine storms — the immune system phenomenon that may lead to fatal outcomes in COVID-19. With this in mind, the scientists studied the cytokine profiles of 91 patients with cytokine storms due to “bacterial sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or burns.” After focusing on various interleukins — a type of cytokine — the scientists found a rise in interleukin-6 (IL-6) early in the disease process, which piqued their interest.  In turn, this increase in IL-6 triggered a rise in a protein called PA-1, which leads to blood clotting. So, the scientists gave participants injections of the antibody-based drug tocilizumab (Actemra), which blocks IL-6 signaling.  When people with severe COVID-19 received tocilizumab, their levels of the blood clotting PA-1 protein decreased. Also, the drug eased symptoms and improved critical illness for these patients. Researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSTL) have devised a new intranasal vaccine, tested in mice with COVID-19. Similar to the Russian vaccine, WUSTL’s counterpart also uses a modified adenovirus inserted with the coronavirus’ spike protein.  In mice, one vaccine dose protected against infection with SARS-CoV-2.  Speaking to MNT about their findings, senior study author Prof. Michael S. Diamond explained that the intranasal vaccine would not use a live form of the virus. This made it safer than other vaccines administered through the nose, such as the regular influenza vaccine. “In these mouse models, the vaccine is highly protective. We’re looking forward to beginning the next round of studies and ultimately testing it in people to see if we can induce the type of protective immunity that we think will not only prevent infection but also curb pandemic transmission of this virus,” said Prof. Diamond. “Any vaccine can cause side effects,” he continued. “However, because the vaccine does not replicate, it could not cause unanticipated infection the way a ‘live’ vaccine could — in this way, it would be safer.” “We will soon begin a study to test this intranasal vaccine in nonhuman primates with a plan to move into human clinical trials as quickly as we can.” — Prof. Michael S. Diamond After much debate, a review pooling data from 19 studies concludes that long-term use of hypertension drugs, known as ACE2 inhibitors, might lower the risk of severe illness from the new coronavirus. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the role of these drugs has been controversial. Some researchers suggest they might worsen outcomes, while other studies show no effect on infection severity. The review, which is the largest meta-analysis on the subject, found that COVID-19 patients with high blood pressure who took the drugs were 33% less likely to die or have severe illness than patients with hypertension who did not take them. Lead researcher Dr. Vassilios Vassiliou, of the Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia, United Kingdom, comments on the findings. He says, “[T]he important thing we showed was that there is no evidence that these medications might increase the severity of COVID-19 or risk of death,” says Dr. Vassiliou. “On the contrary, we found there was a significantly lower risk of death and critical outcomes, so they might, in fact, have a protective role — particularly in patients with hypertension.”  – Dr. Vassilios Vassiliou He continues: “As the world braces itself for a potential second wave of the infection, it is particularly important that we understand the impact that these medications have in COVID-19 patients. Our research provides substantial evidence to recommend continued use of these medications if the patients were taking them already.” For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.

In total, the researchers identified 19 risk factors and dismissed 21 suggestive risk factors based on insufficient scientific evidence. Globally, around 463 million adults lived with diabetes in 2019, according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). In 2015, approximately 9% of all adults had the condition. Diabetes is a condition where sugar or glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of being absorbed into cells. This occurs when cells either lose their ability to produce the hormone insulin or, in type 2 diabetes, they develop insulin resistance and are unable to use it productively.  Over the years, researchers discovered certain factors increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. These potential risk factors include alcohol consumption, skipping breakfast, daytime napping, anxiety disorders, urinary sodium, certain amino acids and inflammatory factors, and lack of sleep. A new study that appears in the journal Diabetologia identifies 19 risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The Sweden-based researchers further evaluated 21 risk factors that have scarce evidence, and another 15 that reduce the risk of the condition. The team used a method called ‘Mendelian randomization’ (MR) to obtain their findings. This technique blends genetic information and conventional epidemiological methods. It also addresses questions related to causality without biases that could compromise the validity of epidemiological approaches. Associate professor Susanna Larsson and Shuai Yuan of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, used data from the Diabetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis consortium. The duo evaluated 74,124 cases of type 2 diabetes and 824,006 control participants with European ancestry for the study population. The participants’ mean age was around 55 years, and 51.8% of them were male.  The researchers then screened 238 studies before including 40 individual papers in their MR investigation. Among the 97 factors they looked at, only 19 increased diabetes risk.  Insomnia was identified as a novel risk factor — people living with the condition are 17% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those without it. Speaking with Medical News Today, Larsson says, “Daytime napping also appears to be a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, because it is strongly related to insomnia, it’s unclear whether daytime napping is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes.” The other risk factors include:  “It is important to highlight that obesity is still the predominant risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The observed association with insomnia was partially, but not fully mediated by obesity (higher body mass index),” adds Larsson. “The association between depression and type 2 diabetes might, in part, be mediated by insomnia.” The exposures associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes include: In their study, the authors further explain: “Findings should inform public health policies for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes. Prevention strategies should be constructed from multiple perspectives, such as lowering obesity and smoking rates and levels, and improving mental health, sleep quality, educational level, and birth weight.” While the study’s findings offer important information that might be useful in drafting public health policies, its major limitation is the study population’s homogenous nature. According to the IDF, 79% of adults with diabetes live in low- and middle-income countries. Studies have also found that the chance of developing diabetes is significantly higher for Black people — around 66 more cases of diabetes per 1,000 people — compared with white adults.  Larsson admits that major risk factors for type 2 diabetes might partly differ by ancestry. “Unfortunately, we were unable to […] perform similar analyses in populations of non-European ancestry,” she says.

The WHO constitution states: \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" An important implication of this definition is that mental health is more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities. Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community. Mental health is fundamental to our collective and individual ability as humans to think, emote, interact with each other, earn a living and enjoy life. On this basis, the promotion, protection and restoration of mental health can be regarded as a vital concern of individuals, communities and societies throughout the world. Multiple social, psychological, and biological factors determine the level of mental health of a person at any point of time. For example, violence and persistent socio-economic pressures are recognized risks to mental health. The clearest evidence is associated with sexual violence. Poor mental health is also associated with rapid social change, stressful work conditions, gender discrimination, social exclusion, unhealthy lifestyle, physical ill-health and human rights violations. There are specific psychological and personality factors that make people vulnerable to mental health problems. Biological risks include genetic factors. Mental health promotion involves actions that improve psychological well-being.\\xa0 This may involve creating an environment that supports mental health.  An environment that respects and protects basic civil, political, socio-economic and cultural rights is fundamental to mental health. Without the security and freedom provided by these rights, it is difficult to maintain a high level of mental health. National mental health policies should be concerned both with mental disorders and, with broader issues that promote mental health. Mental health promotion should be mainstreamed into governmental and nongovernmental policies and programmes. In addition to the health sector, it is essential to involve the education, labour, justice, transport, environment, housing, and welfare sectors. Specific ways to promote mental health include: In the context of national efforts to develop and implement mental health policy, it is vital to not only protect and promote the mental well-being of its citizens, but also address the needs of persons with defined mental disorders. Knowledge of what to do about the escalating burden of mental disorders has improved substantially over the past decade. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating both the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of key interventions for priority mental disorders in countries at different levels of economic development. Examples of interventions that are cost-effective, feasible, and affordable include: A range of effective measures also exists for the prevention of suicide, prevention and treatment of mental disorders in children, prevention and treatment of dementia, and treatment of substance-use disorders. The mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) has produced evidence based guidance for non-specialists to enable them to better identify and manage a range of priority mental health conditions. WHO supports governments in the goal of strengthening and promoting mental health. WHO has evaluated evidence for promoting mental health and is working with governments to disseminate this information and to integrate effective strategies into policies and plans. In 2013, the World Health Assembly approved a \"Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan for 2013-2020\". The Plan is a commitment by all WHO’s Member States to take specific actions to improve mental health and to contribute to the attainment of a set of global targets. The Action Plan’s overall goal is to promote mental well-being, prevent mental disorders, provide care, enhance recovery, promote human rights and reduce the mortality, morbidity and disability for persons with mental disorders. It focuses on 4 key objectives to: Particular emphasis is given in the Action Plan to the protection and promotion of human rights, the strengthening and empowering of civil society and to the central place of community-based care. In order to achieve its objectives, the Action Plan proposes and requires clear actions for governments, international partners and for WHO. Ministries of Health will need to take a leadership role, and WHO will work with them and with international and national partners, including civil society, to implement the plan. As there is no action that fits all countries, each government will need to adapt the Action Plan to its specific national circumstances.

Nearly one in\\xa0five U.S. adults live with a mental illness (46.6 million in 2017). Mental illnesses include many different conditions that vary in degree of severity, ranging from mild to moderate to severe. Two broad categories can be used to describe these conditions: Any Mental Illness (AMI) and Serious Mental Illness (SMI). AMI encompasses all recognized mental illnesses. SMI is a smaller and more severe subset of AMI. Additional information on mental illnesses can be found on the NIMH Health Topics Pages. The data presented here are from the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). For inclusion in NSDUH prevalence estimates, mental illnesses include those that are diagnosable currently or within the past year; of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria specified within the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV); and, exclude developmental and substance use disorders. *All other groups are non-Hispanic or Latino | **NH/OPI = Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander ***AI/AN = American Indian / Alaskan Native *All other groups are non-Hispanic or Latino *All other groups are non-Hispanic or Latino | **NH/OPI = Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander ***AI/AN = American Indian / Alaskan Native *All other groups are non-Hispanic or Latino Diagnostic Assessment: Population: Survey Non-response: Please see the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health Methodological Summary and Definitions report for further information on how these data were collected and calculated.

This study aimed to determine economic factors influencing\\nmental health using multiple regression models in Ilam province in 2013.\\n \\nMethods: In this cross sectional study, 903 families from different cities of Ilam were selected using\\nmultistage cluster sampling. The families were selected from each city separately and each head\\nof family was interviewed. The instruments for data collection included general and economic questionnaires\\nand the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The data were analyzed using SPSS software\\nversion 21, Eviews, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson\\'s correlation coefficient, single and multiple linear\\nregressions.\\n \\nResults: The mean ± SD mental health score in this study was 28.5±12.10. The mental health increased\\nfor 4.26 units per each unit of life satisfaction increase, decreased for 4.09 units per each unit\\nof gender growth, increased for 2.94 units per each unit of increase in economic status and had a significant\\ncorrelation with all the three components (p<0.001).\\n \\nConclusion: In order to improve people\\'s mental health, it is recommended that healthcare officials\\nmay more attention to this matter through implementation of programs such as life skills’ training,\\nstress resistance skills training, and helping individuals to be able to adapt themselves to their life\\nenvironment.\\n \\nMental health has a wide criteria-based range such as ideological, cultural, traditional, economic and geographical conditions (1). The WHO defines mental health as the “ability to have harmonious relationships with others, change and reform the social and individual environment, resolve contradictions and personal tendencies logically, fairly and properly”. Therefore, mental health refers to the possibility for individual and social development of mental healthiness through the prevention of mental disorders, appropriate treatment and rehabilitation (2). Overall, mental health plays key roles in ensuring the efficacy of every society (3,4).\\n \\nMental disorder is one of the most important and significant diseases of which is predicted to increase its portion of the total percentage of diseases for 50% from 10.5% to 15% until 2020 (5). According to studies in Europe and America, between 9% to 16% of females and 5% to 12% of males have a potential depressive disorder during their lifetime and about 4.5% to 9.3% of females and 2.3% to 3.2% of males suffer from related disorders in a period of time throughout their lives (6). Dibaj\\'s study on the mental health conditions of the students indicated that 31.6% of the students were suspected of mental disorders (7). According to the study conducted in England on the socioeconomic conditions and prevalent mental disorders using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), it was found that economic problems have a relationship with prevalent mental disorders in both males and females (8).\\n \\nMental diseases impose a wide range of costs on family members, employers, and the whole society (9). According to the WHO, mental disorders account for 3-4% of gross domestic product (GDP) of countries annually (10). Today, 450 million people in the world are suffering from mental or behavioral disorders (1). According to recent studies in Iran, 21% of the whole population (25.9% of females and 14.6% of males) are also suffering from certain types of mental disorders (11). Poverty, wrong immigration, and living on the fringes of cities are the main factors underlying serious mental health problems and are unfortunately rising in developing countries. Despite having lots of the problems mentioned, the population living on the fringes of cities receive minimum attention in terms of mental health policies (12). Mental inequality can be ascribed to two types of factors: A) flexible and modifiable factors (avoidable inequality), B) inflexible and non-modifiable factors (unavoidable inequality). Socioeconomic conditions, gender, education, social involvement level, occupation, housing quality and ownership can be cited as modifiable factors; and age, gender, nationality and race can be cited as non-modifiable factors. Avoidable inequality is not only a kind of inequality, but also a kind of injustice, as it is human-made and is removable through existing knowledge. If the cause of mental health inequality in a society is discovered, essential policies and strategies will be determined. Therefore, more efficient measures will be taken to improve justice concerning mental health in that society (13).\\n \\nWhile physical health is highly regarded in hospitals and health centers, the dependence of physical health on mental health is neglected. The prevalence of mental disorders increased the need for mental healthcare services, and relative deprivation of the people living in villages and small cities from these services emphasize the significance of this study. It is clear that resolving such problems demands the identification of individual and socioeconomic factors. As a result, necessary actions should be taken in order to prevent mental disorders and have healthier generations in the future. Therefore, this study was conducted in Ilam in 2013 to investigate the economic factors influencing mental health using the multiple regression models.\\n \\nIn this cross sectional study, 903 families from different cities of Ilam were selected using multistage cluster sampling. The families were selected from each city separately and each head of family was interviewed. The families\\' general and economic status was determined using a researcher-made questionnaire consisting of demographic questions (i.e. job status, income, and living expense) which was designed and rated based on Likert scale. The standard General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used to determine the participants\\' general health. This questionnaire is a test with multiple and self-executing nature designed to investigate non-mental disorders found among the existing social states over the month before. In this study, a short questionnaire including 28 questions was used. This questionnaire consisted of 4 subtests. Questions 1-7 were designed to measure physical signs, 8-14 to measure anxiety and sleeplessness, 15-21 to measure social dysfunction, and 22-28 to measure depression. The questions were multiple items and there were two scoring methods. The first method was the Traditional Baymedal method in which the choices are measured based on 0-0, 1-1 and the individual\\'s score ranges from 0 to 28. In the second method, the answers were measured based on Likert (0,1,2,3) in which the individual\\'s score ranges from 0 to 84. The cut-off point obtained for this questionnaire in several studies in Iran is between 21 and 23 (14). In this study, the cut-off point of 23 was used. As a result, the total score between 0 and 23 was considered as desired mental health, and the total number of 24 and above as inappropriate mental health. The reliability of this questionnaire has been proven in different studies (15-18). The Cronbach\\'s alpha was used to determine the reliability of the test which was 0.93 for all the questions.\\n \\nThe data were analyzed using SPSS software version 21, Eviews, t-test, ANOVA test, Pearson\\'s correlation coefficient, single and multiple linear regressions.\\n \\nIn this study, 903 people from Ilam were investigated with a mean ± SD age of 32.7 ±9.45 years (range of 17-78 years). The mental health mean ± SD score for the participants under investigation was 28.5±12.10; it was 26.5±11.82 for males and 29.8±12.18 for females. Gender had a statistically significant relationship with mental health (p<0.001) and 4 subtests mental health (physical symptoms (p<0.001), anxiety and social dysfunction (p=0.034), and Depression (p=0.015), Table 1).\\n \\n*SignificantusingT-test\\n \\nThe highest mental health mean scores belonged to the age group older than 50 (31.3), those cost less than 500 thousand Tomans per month (31.66), those who were unemployed (30.20), those who were under diploma (32.23). According to the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), mental health had a significant relationship with monthly expenses (p=0.046), job status (p<0.001), and education (p=0.021) (Table 2).\\n \\n*Tested by ANOVA\\n \\n**The currency ofthe country the Iran\\n \\nThe findings of this study indicated that monthly income had a negative correlation with physical signs (R=- 0.06, p=0.212), anxiety (R=- 0.06, p=0.197), social dysfunction (R=- 0.1, p=0.027), and depression (R=- 0.08, p=0.070), and a direct correlation with mental health (R=0.1, p=0.039), while it only had a statistically significant relationship with social dysfunction (p=0.027) and mental health (p=0.039) (Table 3).\\n \\n* Significant at a level of less than 0.05\\n \\n** Significant at a level of less than 0.01\\n \\nSix variables were entered into the Multiple Regression Model in order to find the variable which was more related to mental health than the others. After eliminating the confounding variables, life satisfaction component was tested. Based on the obtained amount of Adjusted Coefficient of Determination (R2 adjusted) from this model, 12% of mental health changes were related to life satisfaction and there was a statistically significant relationship between the two variables (p<0.001) (Table 4).\\n \\nIn the second multiple regression model, the relationship between mental health and economic status and gender was investigated. Based on the obtained amount of R2 adjusted from the model, 8% of mental health changes were related to economic status and 6% were related to gender. There was also a significant statistical relationship between mental health and both components (p< 0.001) (Table 4).\\n \\nIn the third multiple regression model, the relationship between mental health and 4 subtests of mental health was investigated. There was a significant statistical relationship between mental health and all the 4 subtests (p< 0.001) (Table 5).\\n \\nAttention to physical, mental, social, and cultural health status in a society and forming the basis for the fulfillment of a healthy and dynamic lifestyle guarantees the healthiness of that society for the future. Prevention of affective disorders, anxiety and depression is most required in achieving such an invaluable goal (19). The mean score for mental health of the participants under investigation was 28.48±12.1; it was 26.46±11.82 for males and 29.84±12.18 for females. Gender had a statistically significant relationship with mental health and 4 subtests of mental health. The findings of the studies by Saberian et al (20) and Manzoori et al (21) also indicated that males were healthier than females in terms of mental health. This can be due to societal structures and social roles of males in a society. Since the society provided males with more power and opportunity than females, they enjoyed a sense of efficacy that may lead to higher mental healthiness.\\n \\nThe results of this study indicated that monthly income had an negative correlation with physical signs, anxiety, social dysfunction and depression, and a direct correlation with mental health, while it only had a significant relationship with social dysfunction (p<0.05) and mental health (p<0.05). In the studies by Love & et al (22), and Sadeghi et al in Iran (23), there was also a positive and significant correlation between income and mental health in a way that families with high income had better mental health. It seems that low income deprives some people of using healthcare services. This may evidently affect peoples\\' mental health.\\n \\nIn the present study, there was a significant statistical relationship between mental health and life satisfaction based on simple regression. For each unit of increase in life satisfaction, mental health would increase for 4.26 units. In the study by Mohammadbeigi et al (24), there was a significant relationship between mental health status and life satisfaction in a way that for each unit of increase in life satisfaction, mental health would increase for 2.58 units. Life satisfaction was a supporting factor against mental disorder symptoms in the present study. Such a fact was also obtained in the study conducted by Bairam et al (25) in Turkey.\\n \\nIn the present study, mental health had a significant relationship with economic status and gender based on multiple regression (p<0.05) in a way that the mental health would decrease for 4.09 units for each unit of increase in the gender, and it would increase for 2.94 units for each unit of increase in the economic status. In a study by Mohammadbeigi et al (24), the possibility of mental disorder affliction in females was 3.96 times more than males. Such results were also seen in similar studies in Turkey (26), Nigeria (27), and Iran (28). It seems that gender is one of the most effective factors in mental disorder affliction, as the results of regression analysis emphasized this point indicating that female gender increases the chance of affliction. The aim of empirical explanation of this finding in scientific texts is to emphasize the existence of growing depression and stress factors in females. Also, it is indicated from the findings of the studies by Ghasemi et al (29) that there was a significant relationship between mental health and economic factors in the participants under investigation in a way that individuals with weak economic status gained the highest score in mental health. Such results were obtained from several other similar studies (30,31). Living with weak economic status has negative effects on families\\' health and welfare. The fixed income-health tilt is proven in the whole world, i.e. peoples\\' health is affected by decreases in socioeconomic conditions.\\n \\nGiven the fact that the participants of the present study had a high general health mean score and their health status was almost worrying, it is recommended that healthcare officials pay more careful attention to this issue than ever through the implementation of programs such as life skills training, stress resistance skills training, and helping individuals to be able to adapt themselves to their life environment in order to promote mental health.\\n \\nWe wish to sincerely thank the Center for Prevention Mental-social Damages of Ilam province, Research and Technology Deputy of Ilam University of Medical Sciences, and all the heads of families whose full cooperation we enjoyed during this study.\\n \\nCite this article as: Behzadifar M, Behzadifar M, Sayehmiri A, Behzadifar M, Sarokhani M, Sayehmiri K.

These disorders can impact a person’s life in significant ways, including how they cope with life events, earn a living, and relate to others. “Why did this happen?” That is a common question that patients and their families have following a psychotic episode, a suicide attempt, or the diagnosis of a mental disorder. Research conducted and funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has found that many mental disorders are caused by a combination of biological, environmental, psychological, and genetic factors. In fact, a growing body of research has found that certain genes and gene variations are associated with mental disorders. So, what is the best way to “look at your genes” and determine your personal risk? Your family health history may be one of your best clues for determining your risk of developing a mental disorder and many other common illnesses. Certain mental disorders tend to run in families, and having a close relative with a mental disorder could mean you are at a higher risk. If a family member has a mental disorder, it does not necessarily mean you will develop one. Many other factors also play a role. But knowing your family’s mental health history can help you determine whether you are at a higher risk for certain disorders, help your doctor to recommend actions for reducing your risk, and enable both you and your doctor to look for early warning signs. To gain a better understanding of your family health history, it may help to talk to your blood relatives, keep a record of your family history, talk with a mental health professional, or visit a genetic counselor. The first step in creating a family health history is to talk to your blood relatives. The most helpful information comes from “first-degree” relatives—parents, brothers, sisters, and children. Information from “second-degree” relatives—such as nieces, nephews, half-brothers, half-sisters, grandparents, aunts, and uncles—also can be helpful. Don\\'t worry if you cannot get complete information on every relative. Some people may not want to talk. Others may be unable to remember information accurately. That’s okay. Whatever information you can collect will be helpful. Free print and online tools can help you create a family health history. One tool, created by the U.S. Surgeon General, is \"My Family Health Portrait\". It helps organize the information in your family health history. You can download and print “My Family Health Portrait” and use it to record information about your family’s health. Once you fill in the information, you can keep it for your records, share the completed form with your doctor or other health care provider, or share it with family members. As a family grows or family members are diagnosed with health conditions, new or updated information can be added. It may take a little time and effort, but this legacy can improve the health of your family for generations to come. If you have mental illness in your family, you may want to consult with a mental health professional who can help you understand risk factors and preventive factors. Asking questions and providing information to your health care provider can improve your care. Talking with your doctor can build trust and may lead to better results, safety, and satisfaction. For tips and information about speaking with your doctor, visit the NIMH Taking Control of Your Mental Health webpage and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality webpage for patients and consumers. Genetic counseling can give you information about how genetic conditions might affect you or your family. The genetic counselor or other health care professional will collect your personal and family health history. They can use this information to determine how likely it is that you or a family member has a genetic condition. Based on this information, the genetic counselor can help you decide whether a genetic test might be right for you or your relative. Genetic testing often is done before or during pregnancy and soon after the birth of children, or if your doctor suspects you may have a rare disease for which specific genes are known to be the cause. To learn more about genetic counseling, visit the Genetic Counseling FAQ page of the National Human Genome Research Institute website and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Genetic Counseling webpage.  Genes are segments of DNA found in almost every cell and are passed down from parents to children. Some diseases are caused by genetic mutation(s) or by a permanent change in one or more specific genes. In other diseases, including many mental disorders, gene variants play a role in increasing or decreasing a person’s risk of developing a disease or condition. Research is advancing our understanding of the role of genetics in mental health. Although there are common genetic variants associated with rare disorders, no gene variant can predict with certainty that a person will develop a mental disorder. In many cases, even the most well-researched genetic variant may contribute to a person’s risk only by very small amounts. Knowing that you have one of these gene variants won’t tell you nearly as much about your risk as your family history can. For more information, visit the website of the National Human Genome Research Institute. Doctors order clinical or diagnostic genetic testing for people they think are at high risk of one of the rare diseases for which specific genes are known to be the cause. In clinical or diagnostic testing, doctors search for a single gene or a few genes that research has strongly associated with a specific disease. The results enable patients and their doctors to make informed health care decisions together. There are many different types of genetic tests. Genetic tests may help to: If a disease runs in your family, your health care professional can tell you if it’s the kind of illness that can be detected through genetic testing. Your health care professional can help you make decisions about whether to be tested and can help you understand test results and their implications. Direct-to-consumer genome scans are different from clinical or diagnostic genetic testing. For a fee, anyone can mail a saliva sample to companies that sell the scan—without a prescription or a health care provider’s advice. Advertisements say that the company then can provide information, based on gene variations, about a person’s risks of developing specific diseases. You can learn about the various types of genetic tests and genetic counseling by visiting the National Human Genome Research Institute website. The short answer to this question is no. Currently, genetic tests cannot accurately predict your risk of developing a mental disorder. Although research is underway, scientists don’t yet know all the gene variations that contribute to mental disorders, and those that are known, so far, raise the risk by very small amounts. One day, genetic research may make it possible to provide a more complete picture of a person’s risk of getting a particular mental disorder or to diagnose it, based on his or her genes. Although recent studies have begun to identify the genetic markers associated with certain mental disorders and eventually may lead to better screening and more personalized treatment, it is still too early to use genetic tests or genome scans to diagnose or treat mental disorders accurately.  NIMH, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), funds and conducts research to help answer important scientific questions about mental illnesses. Through research, NIMH works to determine what is promising, what helps and why, what doesn’t work, and what is safe. For example, the Genomics Research Branch in the NIMH Division of Neuroscience and Basic Behavioral Science and the Human Genetics Branch in the NIMH Intramural Research Program are currently studying and supporting research on the human genetic variations that contribute to the risk for mood and anxiety disorders, such as bipolar disorder and panic disorder, so that better ways to diagnose and treat these disorders can be developed. Research investigating these topics will help the field take steps toward better screening and personalized treatment. You can learn more about ongoing research efforts by visiting the NIMH website (search term: Genetics).

Although individuals may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future. Researchers at NIMH and around the country conduct clinical trials with patients and healthy volunteers. Talk to your health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you. For more information, visit NIMH’s Clinical Trials webpage.

It can alert us to dangers and help us prepare and pay attention. Anxiety disorders differ from normal feelings of nervousness or anxiousness, and involve excessive fear or anxiety. Anxiety disorders are the most common of mental disorders and affect nearly 30 percent of adults at some point in their lives. . But anxiety disorders are treatable and a number of effective treatments are available. Treatment helps most people lead normal productive lives. In any given year the estimated percent of U.S. adults with various anxiety disorders are: Women are more likely than men to experience anxiety disorders. Anxiety refers to anticipation of a future concern and is more associated with muscle tension and avoidance behavior. Fear is an emotional response to an immediate threat and is more associated with a fight or flight reaction – either staying to fight or leaving to escape danger. Anxiety disorders can cause people into try to avoid situations that trigger or worsen their symptoms. Job performance, school work and personal relationships can be affected. In general, for a person to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, the fear or anxiety must: There are several types of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobias, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder and separation anxiety disorder. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Generalized anxiety disorder involves persistent and excessive worry that interferes with daily activities. This ongoing worry and tension may be accompanied by physical symptoms, such as restlessness, feeling on edge or easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, muscle tension or problems sleeping. Often the worries focus on everyday things such as job responsibilities, family health or minor matters such as chores, car repairs, or appointments. Panic Disorder The core symptom of panic disorder is recurrent panic attacks, an overwhelming combination of physical and psychological distress. During an attack several of these symptoms occur in combination: Because symptoms are so severe, many people who experience a panic attack may believe they are having a heart attack or other life-threatening illness and may go to a hospital ER. Panic attacks may be expected, such as a response to a feared object, or unexpected, apparently occurring for no reason. The mean age for onset of panic disorder is 22-23. Panic attacks may occur with other mental disorders such as depression or PTSD. Phobias, Specific Phobia A specific phobia is excessive and persistent fear of a specific object, situation or activity that is generally not harmful. Patients know their fear is excessive, but they can’t overcome it. These fears cause such distress that some people go to extreme lengths to avoid what they fear. Examples are fear of flying or fear of spiders. Agoraphobia Agoraphobia is the fear of being in situations where escape may be difficult or embarrassing, or help might not be available in the event of panic symptoms. The fear is out of proportion to the actual situation and lasts generally six months or more and causes problems in functioning. A person with agoraphobia experiences this fear in two or more of the following situations: The individual actively avoids the situation, requires a companion or endures with intense fear or anxiety. Untreated agoraphobia can become so serious that a person may be unable to leave the house. A person can only be diagnosed with agoraphobia if the fear is intensely upsetting, or if it significantly interferes with normal daily activities. Social Anxiety Disorder (previously called social phobia) A person with social anxiety disorder has significant anxiety and discomfort about being embarrassed, humiliated, rejected or looked down on in social interactions. People with this disorder will try to avoid the situation or endure it with great anxiety. Common examples are extreme fear of public speaking, meeting new people or eating/drinking in public. The fear or anxiety causes problems with daily functioning and lasts at least six months. Separation Anxiety Disorder A person with separation anxiety disorder is excessively fearful or anxious about separation from those with whom he or she is attached. The feeling is beyond what is appropriate for the person’s age, persists (at least four weeks in children and six months in adults) and causes problems functioning. A person with separation anxiety disorder may be persistently worried about losing the person closest to him or her, may be reluctant or refuse to go out or sleep away from home or without that person, or may experience nightmares about separation. Physical symptoms of distress often develop in childhood, but symptoms can carry though adulthood. The causes of anxiety disorders are currently unknown but likely involve a combination of factors including genetic, environmental, psychological and developmental. Anxiety disorders can run in families, suggesting that a combination of genes and environmental stresses can produce the disorders. The first step is to see your doctor to make sure there is no physical problem causing the symptoms. If an anxiety disorder is diagnosed, a mental health professional can work with you on the best treatment. Unfortunately, many people with anxiety disorders don’t seek help. They don’t realize that they have an illness that has effective treatments. Although each anxiety disorder has unique characteristics, most respond well to two types of treatment: psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” and medications. These treatments can be given alone or in combination. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), a type of talk therapy, can help a person learn a different way of thinking, reacting and behaving to help feel less anxious. Medications will not cure anxiety disorders, but can give significant relief from symptoms. The most commonly used medications are anti-anxiety medications (generally prescribed only for a short period of time) and antidepressants. Beta-blockers, used for heart conditions, are sometimes used to control physical symptoms of anxiety. Self-Help, Coping, and Managing There are a number of things people do to help cope with symptoms of anxiety disorders and make treatment more effective. Stress management techniques and meditation can be helpful. Support groups (in-person or online) can provide an opportunity to share experiences and coping strategies. Learning more about the specifics of a disorder and helping family and friends to understand better can also be helpful. Avoid caffeine, which can worsen symptoms, and check with your doctor about any medications. Physician Review By: Ranna Parekh, M.D., M.P.H.

There are three types of bipolar disorder. All three types involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. These moods range from periods of extremely “up,” elated, irritable, or energized behavior (known as manic episodes) to very “down,” sad, indifferent, or hopeless periods (known as depressive episodes). Less severe manic periods are known as hypomanic episodes. Sometimes a person might experience symptoms of bipolar disorder that do not match the three categories listed above, which is referred to as “other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders.” Bipolar disorder is typically diagnosed during late adolescence (teen years) or early adulthood. Occasionally, bipolar symptoms can appear in children. Bipolar disorder can also first appear during a woman’s pregnancy or following childbirth. Although the symptoms may vary over time, bipolar disorder usually requires lifelong treatment. Following a prescribed treatment plan can help people manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. People with bipolar disorder experience periods of unusually intense emotion, changes in sleep patterns and activity levels, and uncharacteristic behaviors—often without recognizing their likely harmful or undesirable effects. These distinct periods are called “mood episodes.” Mood episodes are very different from the moods and behaviors that are typical for the person. During an episode, the symptoms last every day for most of the day. Episodes may also last for longer periods, such as several days or weeks. People having a manic episode may: People having a depressive episode may: Feel very “up,” “high,” elated, or irritable or touchy Feel very sad, “down,” empty, worried, or hopeless Feel “jumpy” or “wired” Feel slowed down or restless Have a decreased need for sleep Have trouble falling asleep, wake up too early, or sleep too much Have a loss of appetite Experience increased appetite and weight gain Talk very fast about a lot of different things Talk very slowly, feel like they have nothing to say, forget a lot Feel like their thoughts are racing Have trouble concentrating or making decisions Think they can do a lot of things at once Feel unable to do even simple things Do risky things that show poor judgment, such as eat and drink excessively, spend or give away a lot of money, or have reckless sex Have little interest in almost all activities, a decreased or absent sex drive, or an inability to experience pleasure (“anhedonia”) Feel like they are unusually important, talented, or powerful Feel hopeless or worthless, think about death or suicide Sometimes people experience both manic and depressive symptoms in the same episode. This kind of episode is called an episode with mixed features. People experiencing an episode with mixed features may feel very sad, empty, or hopeless, while, at the same, time feeling extremely energized. A person may have bipolar disorder even if their symptoms are less extreme. For example, some people with bipolar disorder (Bipolar II) experience hypomania, a less severe form of mania. During a hypomanic episode, a person may feel very good, be able to get things done, and keep up with day-to-day life. The person may not feel that anything is wrong, but family and friends may recognize the changes in mood or activity levels as possible bipolar disorder. Without proper treatment, people with hypomania can develop severe mania or depression. Proper diagnosis and treatment can help people with bipolar disorder lead healthy and active lives. Talking with a doctor or other licensed health care provider is the first step. The health care provider can complete a physical exam and order necessary medical tests to rule out other conditions. The health care provider may then conduct a mental health evaluation or provide a referral to a trained mental health care provider, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker who has experience in diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. Mental health care providers usually diagnose bipolar disorder based on a person’s symptoms, lifetime history, experiences, and, in some cases, family history. Accurate diagnosis in youth is particularly important. You can find tips for talking with your health care provider in the NIMH fact sheet on\\xa0Taking Control of Your Mental Health: Tips for Talking with Your Health Care Provider. Note for Health Care Providers:\\xa0People with bipolar disorder are more likely to seek help when they are depressed than when they are experiencing mania or hypomania. Taking a careful medical history is essential to ensure that bipolar disorder is not mistaken for major depression. This is especially important when treating an initial episode of depression as antidepressant medications can trigger a manic episode in people who have an increased chance of having bipolar disorder. Some bipolar disorder symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses, which can make it challenging for a health care provider to make a diagnosis. In addition, many people may have bipolar disorder along with another mental disorder or condition, such as an anxiety disorder, substance use disorder, or an eating disorder. People with bipolar disorder have an increased chance of having thyroid disease, migraine headaches, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and other physical illnesses. Psychosis: Sometimes, a person with severe episodes of mania or depression may experience psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions. The psychotic symptoms tend to match the person’s extreme mood. For example: As a result, people with bipolar disorder who also have psychotic symptoms are sometimes incorrectly diagnosed with schizophrenia. When people have symptoms of bipolar disorder and also experience periods of psychosis that are separate from mood episodes, the appropriate diagnosis may be schizoaffective disorder. Anxiety: It is common for people with bipolar disorder to also have an anxiety disorder. Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): It is common for people with bipolar disorder to also have ADHD. Misuse of Drugs or Alcohol: People with bipolar disorder may misuse alcohol or drugs and engage in other high-risk behaviors at times of impaired judgment during manic episodes. Although the negative effects of alcohol use or drug use may be most evident to family, friends, and health care providers, it is important to recognize the presence of an associated mental disorder. Eating Disorders: In some cases, people with bipolar disorder also have an eating disorder, such as binge eating or bulimia. Researchers are studying the possible causes of bipolar disorder. Most agree that there is no single cause and it is likely that many factors contribute to a person’s chance of having the illness. Brain Structure and Functioning: Some studies indicate that the brains of people with bipolar disorder may differ from the brains of people who do not have bipolar disorder or any other mental disorder. Learning more about these differences may help scientists understand bipolar disorder and determine which treatments will work best. At this time, health care providers base the diagnosis and treatment plan on a person’s symptoms and history, rather than brain imaging or other diagnostic tests. Genetics: Some research suggests that people with certain genes are more likely to develop bipolar disorder. Research also shows that people who have a parent or sibling with bipolar disorder have an increased chance of having the disorder themselves. Many genes are involved, and no one gene can cause the disorder. Learning more about how genes play a role in bipolar disorder may help researchers develop new treatments. Treatment can help many people, including those with the most severe forms of bipolar disorder. An effective treatment plan usually includes a combination of medication and psychotherapy, also called “talk therapy.” Bipolar disorder is a lifelong illness. Episodes of mania and depression typically come back over time. Between episodes, many people with bipolar disorder are free of mood changes, but some people may have lingering symptoms. Long-term, continuous treatment can help people manage these symptoms. Certain medications can help manage symptoms of bipolar disorder. Some people may need to try several different medications and work with their health care provider before finding medications that work best. Medications generally used to treat bipolar disorder include mood stabilizers and second-generation (“atypical”) antipsychotics. Treatment plans may also include medications that target sleep or anxiety. Health care providers often prescribe antidepressant medication to treat depressive episodes in bipolar disorder, combining the antidepressant with a mood stabilizer to prevent triggering a manic episode. People taking medication should: Avoid stopping a medication without talking to a health care provider first. Suddenly stopping a medication may lead to a “rebound” or worsening of bipolar disorder symptoms. For basic information about medications, visit NIMH’s Mental Health Medications webpage. For the most up-to-date information on medications, side effects, and warnings, visit the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Medication Guides website. Psychotherapy, also called “talk therapy,” can be an effective part of the treatment plan for people with bipolar disorder. Psychotherapy is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help a person identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It can provide support, education, and guidance to people with bipolar disorder and their families. Treatment may include therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychoeducation, which are used to treat a variety of conditions. Treatment may also include newer therapies designed specifically for the treatment of bipolar disorder, including interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) and family-focused therapy. Determining whether intensive psychotherapeutic intervention at the earliest stages of bipolar disorder can prevent or limit its full-blown onset is an important area of ongoing research. Visit NIMH’s Psychotherapies webpage to learn about the various types of psychotherapies. Some people may find other treatments helpful in managing their bipolar symptoms, including: Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT): ECT is a brain stimulation procedure that can help people get relief from severe symptoms of bipolar disorder. With modern ECT, a person usually goes through a series of treatment sessions over several weeks. ECT is delivered under general anesthesia and is safe. It can be effective in treating severe depressive and manic episodes, which occur most often when medication and psychotherapy are not effective or are not safe for a particular patient. ECT can also be effective when a rapid response is needed, as in the case of suicide risk or catatonia (a state of unresponsiveness). More research is needed to determine the effects of other treatments, including: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): TMS is a newer approach to brain stimulation that uses magnetic waves. It is delivered to an awake patient most days for 1 month. Research shows that TMS is helpful for many people with various subtypes of depression, but its role in the treatment of bipolar disorder is still under study. Supplements: Although there are reports that some supplements and herbs may help, not enough research has been conducted to fully understand how these supplements may affect people with bipolar disorder. It is important for a health care provider to know about all prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and supplements a patient is taking. Certain medications and supplements taken together may cause unwanted or dangerous effects. Regular Exercise: Regular aerobic exercise, such as jogging, brisk walking, swimming, or bicycling, helps with depression and anxiety, promotes better sleep, and is healthy for your heart and brain. There is also some evidence that anaerobic exercise such as weightlifting, yoga, and Pilates can be helpful. Check with your health care provider before you start a new exercise regimen. Keeping a Life Chart: Even with proper treatment, mood changes can occur. Treatment is more effective when a patient and health care provider work together and talk openly about concerns and choices. Keeping a life chart that records daily mood symptoms, treatments, sleep patterns, and life events can help patients and health care providers track and treat bipolar disorder over time. Patients can easily share data collected via smartphone apps – including self-reports, self- ratings, and activity data – with their health care providers and therapists. If you are in crisis: Call the toll-free National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The service is available to everyone. All calls are confidential. Contact social media outlets directly if you are concerned about a friend’s social media updates or dial 911 in an emergency. If you are thinking about harming yourself or thinking about suicide: Living with bipolar disorder can be challenging, but there are ways to help make it easier for yourself, a friend, or a loved one. Remember: Bipolar disorder is a lifelong illness, but long-term, ongoing treatment can help control symptoms and enable you to live a healthy life. Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individuals may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future. Researchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials uncovered years ago. Be part of tomorrow’s medical breakthroughs. Talk to your health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.

Top Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders currently lists five types: bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic disorder, other specified bipolar and related disorders, and unspecified bipolar and related disorders. In the United States, about 4.4 percent of adults experience bipolar disorder at some point. People with bipolar disorder tend to have moods marked by highs and lows, or periods of mania and depression. The duration and intensity of these episodes enable health professionals to determine which subtype of bipolar disorder a person has. The categories include: Bipolar I and II are the most common subtypes, with bipolar I being more severe in terms of manic symptoms. Symptoms of bipolar disorder include episodes of mania or hypomania and can include depression.People may also have periods during which they feel fairly stable. Symptoms vary and may change over time. Manic episodes involve extreme highs, during which a person may experience: Manic periods can affect a person’s daily life, job, and relationships. Symptoms of hypomania are similar to those of mania, but they are less severe. Nonetheless, others often notice these symptoms, which can interfere with the person’s life and relationships. According to a 2012 study in the journal American Family Physician, while bipolar disorder involves manic or hypomanic symptoms, most people with the condition experience depression the majority of the time. Depressive symptoms of bipolar disorder are the same as the symptoms of clinical depression and include: For health professionals to classify these symptoms as depression, they must last for at least 2 weeks. Bipolar I and II may cause additional symptoms, such as anxiety or psychosis. During psychotic episodes, people lose touch with reality and may experience hallucinations or delusions. People with bipolar I or II may experience what doctors call “rapid cycling.” This means that they have had at least 4 episodes in the previous year, with occasional periods of remission for at least 2 months or a shift to the opposite mood, such as from mania to depression. It can be difficult to identify symptoms in younger people because the signs can resemble regular developmental highs and lows. Patterns of symptoms in children and teenagers can also differ from those in adults. Most people with bipolar disorder receive a diagnosis in early adulthood, after symptoms have persisted for several years. A doctor or psychiatric nurse practitioner will diagnose bipolar disorder based on a person’s medical history and symptoms. They may: To rule out other causes of depressive and manic symptoms, a doctor may also perform a physical examination, blood tests, or brain scans. A healthcare provider will suggest a treatment plan based on the person’s symptoms and situation. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, so treatment aims to manage symptoms. Treatment options include: Prescribers often recommend medications for people with bipolar disorder, with many individuals taking multiple drugs. The mood stabilizer lithium is a common treatment, with some research suggesting that it can significantly help prevent long-term relapse. Other medicines for bipolar disorder include: Psychotherapy can be an important treatment component for people with bipolar disorder. It can enable them to recognize changes in thoughts and mood and respond accordingly. Therapy can also help people establish healthful routines and learn new coping skills. It may take place on a one-to-one basis, with family, or as part of a group. Most people with bipolar disorder and other mood disorders find lifestyle changes beneficial. Typical changes include: Experts do not know exactly what causes bipolar disorder, although they believe that several factors play a role. These include: Most likely, a combination of heredity and environmental factors plays a role in bipolar development. There are several types of bipolar disorder, with significant symptom overlap between them. While bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, treatments such as medications, therapy, and lifestyle modifications can effectively help people manage their symptoms. To support their mental health, it is vital for people with bipolar disorder to seek help from others and stay in regular contact with their doctors.

Depressive episodes linked to the summer can occur, but are much less common than winter episodes of SAD. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is not considered as a separate disorder. It is a type of depression displaying a recurring seasonal pattern. To be diagnosed with SAD, people must meet full criteria for major depression coinciding with specific seasons (appearing in the winter or summer months) for at least 2 years. Seasonal depressions must be much more frequent than any non-seasonal depressions. Symptoms of the Winter Pattern of SAD include: Symptoms of the less frequently occurring summer seasonal affective disorder include: Attributes that may increase your risk of SAD include: The causes of SAD are unknown, but research has found some biological clues:\\xa0 There are four major types of treatment for SAD: \\xa0These may be used alone or in combination. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to treat SAD. The FDA has also approved the use of bupropion, another type of antidepressant, for treating SAD. As with other medications, there are side effects to SSRIs. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition. You may need to try several different antidepressant medications before finding the one that improves your symptoms without causing problematic side effects. For basic information about SSRIs and other mental health medications, visit NIMH’s Medications webpage. Check the FDA’s website for the latest information on warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications. Light therapy has been a mainstay of treatment for SAD since the 1980s. The idea behind light therapy is to replace the diminished sunshine of the fall and winter months using daily exposure to bright, artificial light. Symptoms of SAD may be relieved by sitting in front of a light box first thing in the morning, on a daily basis from the early fall until spring. Most typically, light boxes filter out the ultraviolet rays and require 20-60 minutes of exposure to 10,000 lux of cool-white fluorescent light, an amount that is about 20 times greater than ordinary indoor lighting. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is type of psychotherapy that is effective for SAD. Traditional cognitive behavioral therapy has been adapted for use with SAD (CBT-SAD). CBT-SAD relies on basic techniques of CBT such as identifying negative thoughts and replacing them with more positive thoughts along with a technique called behavioral activation. Behavioral activation seeks to help the person identify activities that are engaging and pleasurable, whether indoors or outdoors, to improve coping with winter. At present, vitamin D supplementation by itself is not regarded as an effective SAD treatment. The reason behind its use is that low blood levels of vitamin D were found in people with SAD. The low levels are usually due to insufficient dietary intake or insufficient exposure to sunshine. However, the evidence for its use has been mixed. While some studies suggest vitamin D supplementation may be as effective as light therapy, others found vitamin D had no effect. Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions, including seasonal affective disorder. During clinical trials, treatments might be new drugs or new combinations of drugs, new psychotherapies or devices, or new ways to use existing treatments. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individual participants may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future. Please Note: Decisions about whether to apply for a clinical trial and which ones are best suited for a given individual are best made in collaboration with your licensed health professional. Scientists at the NIMH campus conduct research on numerous areas of study, including cognition, genetics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. The studies take place at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland and usually require regular visits. After an initial phone interview to see if any of the clinical trials recruiting subjects are a good match for you, you will come to an appointment at the clinic and meet with a clinician.

Top Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is now more commonly known as major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern. It is a type of depression that tends to affect people who live in countries farther from the equator. It is most common during the winter months and tends to resolve in springtime. Other names for major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern include SAD, winter depression, and seasonal depression. According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the condition affects about 5% of people in the United States. Symptoms can last for approximately 40% of the year. In this article, we look at how this condition develops, who might be at risk, and the available treatment options. People with SAD, or major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, experience symptoms of depression with gradually increasing frequency as days start getting shorter. These symptoms slowly improve in early spring, as the amount of sunlight increases. The APA suggest that this condition might occur when reduced exposure to sunlight triggers a chemical imbalance in the brain. However, more research is necessary to confirm the cause. Seasonal changes in sunlight affect the circadian rhythms that regulate a person’s sense of time. Some people consider this to be their “internal biological clock,” and disruption to the circadian rhythm can significantly disrupt mood. According to Harvard Medical School, women experience SAD more often than men. SAD also develops in young people more often than in older adults. It is also more common in people who live farther north of the equator, as winter further reduces the hours of daylight in these locations. Less commonly, some people experience SAD during the summer months. The symptoms of SAD are similar to those of depression. The major difference is that symptoms develop as winter approaches and resolve during springtime. Most people’s symptoms occur and resolve at the same time every year. Symptoms are usually mild as autumn advances and the hours of daylight start to decline. The severity, characteristics, and patterns of SAD can vary considerably from person to person. The signs and symptoms of SAD tend to include: A doctor may not diagnose this condition in people who experience SAD as an effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors. For instance, people who work seasonally may not have employment during the winter, and they may exhibit some symptoms of depression as a result. Some people experience these symptoms during the summer rather than the winter, with symptoms resolving during the wintertime. However, the most common presentation of SAD occurs during the winter months.  Certain factors can affect a person’s risk of developing SAD. We discuss these in more detail below: Women are more likely than men to experience SAD, though this may be due to the higher prevalence of overall depression among women. According to a 2015 overview in the journal Depression Research and Treatment, diagnoses of SAD are four times more common in women than men. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) suggest that living farther from the equator can increase the risk of developing SAD. People who live in places where the days are much shorter in winter are more susceptible. Having close relatives with a history of other types of depression can increase the likelihood that SAD may develop. People with a history of depression or bipolar disorder, as well as those who currently have either of these conditions, are more likely to develop SAD. However, a doctor will only reach a diagnosis of SAD if depression symptoms become more common during a particular season each year. Experts are still unsure of the exact causes of SAD. However, studies have pointed to the following factors: Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in moderating mood. It binds to a particular protein to travel around the body. Levels of this protein usually drop during the winter months to protect a person against the environmental stress of the season. However, one 2016 longitudinal study in the journal Brain found that people with SAD do not experience a decrease in serotonin transporter levels during winter. The risk is especially high in people who are prone to affective disorders. Melatonin is a hormone that influences sleep patterns and mood. The NIMH maintain that reduced exposure to sunlight during winter’s shorter days disrupts the balance of melatonin in the body. A 2018 study in rats, the results of which appear in the journal Genes & Nutrition, found links between vitamin D and serotonin that could explain the onset of depression in some people. The body produces vitamin D after exposure to sunlight. Getting less sunlight during the winter months might explain the cycle of depressive symptoms that characterize SAD. The doctor may ask the following questions to identify whether or not SAD is present: Because there are several types of depression, it might take some time for a doctor to diagnose SAD accurately. No medical or laboratory test is available for diagnosing this condition. However, the doctor may order some diagnostic tests, including blood tests, to rule out other illnesses or underlying conditions. The APA do not class SAD as a separate disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). Instead, SAD is a “course specifier.” A healthcare professional will only diagnose SAD if a person has symptoms of major depressive disorder that develop and resolve at specific times each year. According to the APA, a person may be able to alleviate SAD symptoms by increasing their exposure to sunlight. For example, going for long walks when there is still some sunlight could help. Treating SAD usually involves medication, therapy, and lightbox therapy. Lifestyle adjustments can also help reduce the impact of SAD. Although SAD seems to occur due to changes in brain chemistry, therapy that focuses on mood and behavior can also help. The APA suggest that this type of therapy may have a longer lasting benefit than taking medications or using a lightbox to manage mood. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help people monitor and control their reactions to certain situations and environments more successfully. If a person can alter the way they perceive events, their behavior will also change with time. This may help reduce the severity of their symptoms during the season in which the effects of SAD peak. A course of CBT usually includes an individual program of thought and breathing exercises to help a person identify and moderate negative feelings. People can attend group or partner sessions of CBT. Such sessions provide support and advice to those who live with people with SAD. A healthcare provider may prescribe an antidepressant, usually a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This type of medication increases serotonin levels. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have now approved bupropion (Wellbutrin XL) for specific use by people who have SAD. People should always follow their doctor’s instruction when taking these drugs and check the prescribing information for side effects and potential risks. In this article, learn more about antidepressants. If a person’s symptoms are severe enough to impact daily function, a doctor may recommend bright light therapy. Also known as phototherapy, this intervention can help restore a person’s circadian rhythms. In bright light therapy, a person sits in front of a specialized lightbox for a set amount of time every day between early fall and spring. Ultraviolet lamps, full spectrum lights, and tanning lamps will not have the same effect for people with SAD. The NIMH recommend engaging in lightbox exposure as soon as possible after waking up. In general, people should receive light therapy for 20–60 minutes per day, depending on the strength of the light. Some people with SAD find that increasing their exposure to natural sunlight can help alleviate symptoms. Examples include opening blinds and curtains, trimming trees around the house, and sitting closer to the window during the daytime. Getting outside every day for a long spell in the open air may help, as might staying social and active. The seasonal nature of SAD means that planning activities ahead of the season can help reduce its impact on everyday life. Similarly, maintaining regular exercise and a balanced, nutritious diet are great for overall health. They might also help a person alleviate symptoms of anxiety and support a more regular sleep cycle.  Can seasonal depression turn into a type that occurs all year round?   According to the APA, a healthcare professional must diagnose SAD, or major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, in subsequent episodes. There must be a seasonal relationship between the onset of a major depressive episode and a particular time of the year, such as fall or winter. With this in mind, symptoms can occur at any time and may persist after the symptoms of the depressive episode have improved (for instance, in the summer). However, for people whose episode began in fall or winter and did not resolve in the summer, it would be major depressive disorder. Careful recordkeeping of symptoms may help the person’s mental health provider define the type of major depressive disorder they have and suggest an appropriate treatment plan.   Last medically reviewed on  August 12, 2019 Closer adherence to the DASH diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, could help to stave off depression, new research reveals.

People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality, which causes significant distress for the individual, their family members, and friends. If left untreated, the symptoms of schizophrenia can be persistent and disabling. However, effective treatments are available. When delivered in a timely, coordinated, and sustained manner, treatment can help affected individuals to engage in school or work, achieve independence, and enjoy personal relationships. Schizophrenia is typically diagnosed in the late teen years to the early thirties and tends to emerge earlier in males (late adolescence – early twenties) than females (early twenties – early thirties). A diagnosis of schizophrenia often follows the first episode of psychosis, when individuals first display symptoms of schizophrenia. Gradual changes in thinking, mood, and social functioning often begin before the first episode of psychosis, usually starting in mid-adolescence. Schizophrenia can occur in younger children, but it is rare for it to occur before late adolescence. The symptoms of schizophrenia generally fall into the following three categories: Psychotic symptoms include altered perceptions (e.g., changes in vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste), abnormal thinking, and odd behaviors. People with psychotic symptoms may lose a shared sense of reality and experience themselves and the world in a distorted way. Specifically, individuals typically experience: Negative symptoms include loss of motivation, disinterest or lack of enjoyment in daily activities, social withdrawal, difficulty showing emotions, and difficulty functioning normally. Specifically, individuals typically have: Cognitive symptoms include problems in attention, concentration, and memory. For some individuals, the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are subtle, but for others, they are more prominent and interfere with activities like following conversations, learning new things, or remembering appointments. Specifically, individuals typically experience:  Several factors contribute to the risk of developing schizophrenia. Genetics:  Schizophrenia sometimes runs in families. However, it is important to know that just because someone in a family has schizophrenia, it does not mean that other members of the family will have it as well. Genetic studies strongly suggest that many different genes increase the risk of developing schizophrenia, but that no single gene causes the disorder by itself. It is not yet possible to use genetic information to predict who will develop schizophrenia. Environment:  Scientists think that interactions between genetic risk and aspects of an individual’s environment may play a role in the development of schizophrenia. Environmental factors that may be involved include living in poverty, stressful surroundings, and exposure to viruses or nutritional problems before birth. Brain structure and function:  Scientists think that differences in brain structure, function, and interactions among chemical messengers (called neurotransmitters) may contribute to the development of schizophrenia. For example, differences in the volumes of specific components of the brain, in the way regions of the brain are connected and work together, and in neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, are found in people with schizophrenia. Differences in brain connections and brain circuits seen in people with schizophrenia may begin developing before birth. Changes to the brain that occur during puberty may trigger psychotic episodes in people who are vulnerable due to genetics, environmental exposures, or the types of brain differences mentioned above. The causes of schizophrenia are complex and are not fully understood, so current treatments focus on managing symptoms and solving problems related to day to day functioning. Treatments include: Antipsychotic medications can help reduce the intensity and frequency of psychotic symptoms. They are usually taken daily in pill or liquid forms. Some antipsychotic medications are given as injections once or twice a month, which some individuals find to be more convenient than daily oral doses. Patients whose symptoms do not improve with standard antipsychotic medication typically receive clozapine. People treated with clozapine must undergo routine blood testing to detect a potentially dangerous side effect that occurs in 1-2% of patients. Many people taking antipsychotic medications have side effects such as weight gain, dry mouth, restlessness, and drowsiness when they start taking these medications. Some of these side effects subside over time, but others may persist, which may cause some people to consider stopping their antipsychotic medication. Suddenly stopping medication can be dangerous and it can make schizophrenia symptoms worse. People should not stop taking antipsychotic medication without talking to a health care provider first. Shared decision making between doctors and patients is the recommended strategy for determining the best type of medication or medication combination and the right dose. You can find the latest information on warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website. Cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral skills training, supported employment, and cognitive remediation interventions may help address the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. A combination of these therapies and antipsychotic medication is common. Psychosocial treatments can be helpful for teaching and improving coping skills to address the everyday challenges of schizophrenia. They can help people pursue their life goals, such as attending school, working, or forming relationships. Individuals who participate in regular psychosocial treatment are less likely to relapse or be hospitalized. For more information on psychosocial treatments, see the Psychotherapies webpage on the NIMH website. Educational programs for family members, significant others, and friends offer instruction about schizophrenia symptoms and treatments, and strategies for assisting the person with the illness. Increasing key supporters’ understanding of psychotic symptoms, treatment options, and the course of recovery can lessen their distress, bolster coping and empowerment, and strengthen their capacity to offer effective assistance. Family-based services may be provided on an individual basis or through multi-family workshops and support groups. For more information about family-based services in your area, you can visit the family education and support groups page on the National Alliance on Mental Illness website. Coordinated specialty care (CSC) is a general term used to describe recovery-oriented treatment programs for people with first episode psychosis, an early stage of schizophrenia. A team of health professionals and specialists deliver CSC, which includes psychotherapy, medication management, case management, employment and education support, and family education and support. The person with early psychosis and the team work together to make treatment decisions, involving family members as much as possible. Compared to typical care for early psychosis, CSC is more effective at reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing involvement in work or school. Check here for more information about CSC programs. Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is designed especially for individuals with schizophrenia who are at risk for repeated hospitalizations or homelessness. The key elements of ACT include a multidisciplinary team, including a medication prescriber, a shared caseload among team members, direct service provision by team members, a high frequency of patient contact, low patient to staff ratios, and outreach to patients in the community. ACT reduces hospitalizations and homelessness among individuals with schizophrenia. Check here for more information about ACT programs. Caring for and supporting a loved one with schizophrenia can be very challenging. It can be difficult to know how to respond to someone who is experiencing psychosis. Some symptoms require immediate emergency care. If your loved one is thinking about harming themselves or others or attempting suicide, seek help right away: The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides the Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator for finding mental health treatment facilities and programs. SAMHSA’s Early Serious Mental Illness Treatment Locator provides information about treatment facilities that offer coordinated specialty care. For additional resources, visit the NIMH Help for Mental Illnesses page. Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individuals may benefit directly from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge to help others in the future. Researchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials uncovered years ago. Be part of tomorrow’s medical breakthroughs. Talk to your doctor about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you. To learn more about participating in clinical trials, visit the NIMH Clinical Trials page.

Top A study links the consumption of ultra-processed foods with the shortening of the body’s telomeres.  Telomeres are structures located at the ends of our chromosomes. Although they contain no genetic information themselves, they preserve the integrity of chromosomes by keeping their ends from fraying, much as shoelace tips protect the laces. Telomeres become shorter and less effective over time as chromosomes replicate. Scientists view them as markers of an individual’s biological age at a cellular level. New research indicates that eating ultra-processed foods is linked to the accelerated shortening of telomeres and cell aging. The researchers, from the University of Navarra in Pamplona, Spain, presented their findings at this year’s European and International Congress on Obesity (ECOICO 2020) in September. The findings also feature in a study paper in The Americal Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Lucia Alonso-Pedrero, who is a doctoral researcher at this university, led the study. The consumption of ultra-processed foods, or UPFs, is on the rise worldwide. UPFs are manufactured food products comprising the building blocks of naturally occurring foods: protein isolates, sugars, fats, and oils. However, while their components are often extracted from natural sources, UPFs ultimately contain no, or very little, in the way of whole foods. The companies that produce UPFs often add flavorings and emulsifiers for taste, as well as colorings and other cosmetic additives to achieve the desired appearance. UPFs are nutritionally poor and often unbalanced. UPFs are highly profitable for their producers due to their inexpensive ingredients, cost effective manufacturing processes, and long shelf life in stores. What makes them so attractive to consumers is their convenience and their relative imperishability. Previous research has not conclusively established a link between UPFs in general and telomere length (TL). However, researchers have noted associations between TL and alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages, processed meats, and foods high in saturated fat and sugar. Other research indicates a UPF connection to several serious conditions, such as obesity, hypertension, depression, metabolic syndrome, some types of cancer, and type 2 diabetes. However, these conditions also tend to be age-related and thus difficult to associate definitively with the consumption of UPFs. The NOVA system classifies foods according to the degree of processing that their production involves, as opposed to their nutritional content. The goal of Alonso-Pedrero and her colleagues was to investigate the effect of UPF consumption in older adults using NOVA as a means of categorizing the foods that they consumed. The researchers began their analysis with data from the SUN project, which the University of Navarra is conducting with other Spanish universities. The ongoing study began recruiting in 2000 and includes volunteers over the age of 20 years. Participants are required to fill out and return questionnaires every 2 years. In 2008, all SUN participants over the age of 55 years took part in a genetic study that forms the foundation of the new research. A total of 886 individuals — 645 men and 241 women — provided saliva samples for DNA analysis and self-reported their daily food consumption. Their average age was 67.7 years. The team sorted the participants into four groups of equal size, or quartiles, according to the number of UPF servings that they consumed daily: In terms of telomeres, Alonso-Pedrero and her colleagues detected a clear correspondence between TL and the consumption of UPFs. The likelihood of shortened telomeres increased dramatically with the number of UPF servings, starting with the medium-low group. That group was 29% more likely to exhibit reduced TL, while the medium-high group was 40% more likely to do so. Those in the high group were 82% more likely to have shortened telomeres. The study’s authors write: “In this cross-sectional study of elderly Spanish subjects, we showed a robust strong association between UPF consumption and TL. Further research in larger longitudinal studies with baseline and repeated measures of TL is needed to confirm these observations.” The researchers also made a number of general observations regarding those who consumed more than 3 servings of UPFs per day. People in this quartile: Individuals who ate more UPFs were less likely to adhere to a healthful Mediterranean diet. In exchange, they consumed more fats, saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats, sodium, sugar-sweetened beverages, cholesterol, fast food, and processed meats. The study authors also found that those who consumed higher amounts of UPFs were more likely to experience depression — especially when they were less active physically. Finally, the findings linked the consumption of UPFs to excessive body weight, hypertension, and all-cause mortality. This article identifies the 15 most healthful foods based on recent research.

In their latest advice, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that people with moderate-to-severe asthma may be at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19. However, a review of research by scientists at the University of Colorado in Denver has found no evidence of an increased prevalence of asthma among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with the condition’s prevalence in the wider population. In addition, they found that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had asthma were no more likely to be intubated than other patients. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. “The CDC [place] people with asthma at higher risk [of] COVID-related hospitalization,” says senior author Dr. Fernando Holguin. “However, many international studies show low numbers of [asthmatic people] among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. These findings challenge the assumption about asthma as a risk factor.” In a research letter that appears in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society, the authors report:  “Despite early concern about disproportionately high morbidity and mortality for those with asthma, data presented here and elsewhere show minimal evidence of a clinically significant relationship.” For their analysis, the researchers identified 15 studies published in English before May 7, 2020, that reported on asthma prevalence among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The studies took place in Brazil, China, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. When they compared these figures with the prevalence of asthma in each population, the numbers were broadly similar. Although the prevalence of asthma among hospitalized COVID-19 patients varied widely from study to study, the overall prevalence was around 7%.  By contrast, the authors found that people with asthma accounted for more than 20% of all those hospitalized with influenza in the U.S.  Finally, they looked at whether or not patients admitted to the University of Colorado Hospital with COVID-19 were more likely to be intubated if they had asthma. After adjusting for the patients’ age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), they found no evidence that this was the case. In conclusion, they write: “While there is variable asthma prevalence among COVID-19 published studies, it appears similar to population prevalence, and certainly much lower than what would be expected during seasonal flu. The results of this study suggest that asthma does not appear to be a significant risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization or intubation.” The authors speculate that people with asthma who use inhaled corticosteroids may have fewer ACE2 receptors in the lining of their respiratory tract as a result. These are the receptors that the virus uses to enter its host’s cells. They add that people with asthma in general, and allergic asthma in particular, may have fewer ACE2 receptors. However, they write that the effect of ACE2 receptor numbers on a person’s risk of COVID-19 and disease severity remains unclear and merits further investigation. They also acknowledge that their study had some limitations. For example, the prevalence of asthma among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 varied widely between studies, which suggests that there was a lack of consistency in reporting comorbid conditions. Also, some studies did not describe how the researchers gathered data on asthma diagnoses. The authors also note that their sample size may not be large enough to draw definitive conclusions. They call for more research into the risk of severe COVID-19 for people with asthma. For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.

No current medicine can prevent or cure COVID-19. However, scientists are testing and developing novel therapeutic options. Learn more about them here. While the pandemic is still ongoing, we continue to round up the scientific studies that offer encouraging results to help us envisage an end to the current crisis. Firstly, scientists at the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, in Moscow, devised a vaccine that elicits a robust immune response, with no serious side effects in humans.  The last few weeks also saw the development of a much faster COVID-19 test and an intranasal vaccine that was effective in mice.  Finally, a meta-analysis helps settle the matter of whether blood pressure drugs make COVID-19 better or worse, while an arthritis drug may reduce severe illness. Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment. The Russian vaccine, known as Sputnik V, uses a modified version of an adenovirus that causes the common cold. Denis Logunov, the study’s first author and head of the research lab at Gamaleya, explains how it works. “When adenovirus vaccines enter people’s cells, they deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein genetic code, which causes cells to produce the spike protein. This helps teach the immune system to recognize and attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus,” Logunov says. The researchers assessed the vaccine in a small phase 1 and 2 trial that lasted 42 days and included 38 healthy participants aged 18–60. At this point in the study, the scientists wanted to assess the vaccine’s safety and its ability to elicit an immune response, rather than whether it can prevent infections with the new coronavirus.  The results showed a strong immune response in the participants. They developed antibodies and more advanced immune responses, similar to T cell reactions. T cells are white immune cells — some of which, called killer T cells, can find and kill infected cells.  The Russian vaccine was also found to be safe and did not elicit any serious side effects. Next, the team plans to enter phase 3 of the trial, which will involve 40,000 participants.  Japanese-based scientists from Osaka University and Osaka Habikino Medical Center believe they could repurpose an arthritis drug to treat severe COVID-19.  The team began their research by focusing on cytokines, proteins secreted by immune cells, with key immunomodulatory functions. They aimed to understand their role in cytokine storms — the immune system phenomenon that may lead to fatal outcomes in COVID-19. With this in mind, the scientists studied the cytokine profiles of 91 patients with cytokine storms due to “bacterial sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or burns.” After focusing on various interleukins — a type of cytokine — the scientists found a rise in interleukin-6 (IL-6) early in the disease process, which piqued their interest.  In turn, this increase in IL-6 triggered a rise in a protein called PA-1, which leads to blood clotting. So, the scientists gave participants injections of the antibody-based drug tocilizumab (Actemra), which blocks IL-6 signaling.  When people with severe COVID-19 received tocilizumab, their levels of the blood clotting PA-1 protein decreased. Also, the drug eased symptoms and improved critical illness for these patients. Researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSTL) have devised a new intranasal vaccine, tested in mice with COVID-19. Similar to the Russian vaccine, WUSTL’s counterpart also uses a modified adenovirus inserted with the coronavirus’ spike protein.  In mice, one vaccine dose protected against infection with SARS-CoV-2.  Speaking to MNT about their findings, senior study author Prof. Michael S. Diamond explained that the intranasal vaccine would not use a live form of the virus. This made it safer than other vaccines administered through the nose, such as the regular influenza vaccine. “In these mouse models, the vaccine is highly protective. We’re looking forward to beginning the next round of studies and ultimately testing it in people to see if we can induce the type of protective immunity that we think will not only prevent infection but also curb pandemic transmission of this virus,” said Prof. Diamond. “Any vaccine can cause side effects,” he continued. “However, because the vaccine does not replicate, it could not cause unanticipated infection the way a ‘live’ vaccine could — in this way, it would be safer.” “We will soon begin a study to test this intranasal vaccine in nonhuman primates with a plan to move into human clinical trials as quickly as we can.” — Prof. Michael S. Diamond After much debate, a review pooling data from 19 studies concludes that long-term use of hypertension drugs, known as ACE2 inhibitors, might lower the risk of severe illness from the new coronavirus. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the role of these drugs has been controversial. Some researchers suggest they might worsen outcomes, while other studies show no effect on infection severity. The review, which is the largest meta-analysis on the subject, found that COVID-19 patients with high blood pressure who took the drugs were 33% less likely to die or have severe illness than patients with hypertension who did not take them. Lead researcher Dr. Vassilios Vassiliou, of the Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia, United Kingdom, comments on the findings. He says, “[T]he important thing we showed was that there is no evidence that these medications might increase the severity of COVID-19 or risk of death,” says Dr. Vassiliou. “On the contrary, we found there was a significantly lower risk of death and critical outcomes, so they might, in fact, have a protective role — particularly in patients with hypertension.”  – Dr. Vassilios Vassiliou He continues: “As the world braces itself for a potential second wave of the infection, it is particularly important that we understand the impact that these medications have in COVID-19 patients. Our research provides substantial evidence to recommend continued use of these medications if the patients were taking them already.” For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.

T cells are white immune cells — some of which, called killer T cells, can find and kill infected cells.  The Russian vaccine was also found to be safe and did not elicit any serious side effects. Next, the team plans to enter phase 3 of the trial, which will involve 40,000 participants.  Japanese-based scientists from Osaka University and Osaka Habikino Medical Center believe they could repurpose an arthritis drug to treat severe COVID-19.  The team began their research by focusing on cytokines, proteins secreted by immune cells, with key immunomodulatory functions. They aimed to understand their role in cytokine storms — the immune system phenomenon that may lead to fatal outcomes in COVID-19. With this in mind, the scientists studied the cytokine profiles of 91 patients with cytokine storms due to “bacterial sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or burns.” After focusing on various interleukins — a type of cytokine — the scientists found a rise in interleukin-6 (IL-6) early in the disease process, which piqued their interest.  In turn, this increase in IL-6 triggered a rise in a protein called PA-1, which leads to blood clotting. So, the scientists gave participants injections of the antibody-based drug tocilizumab (Actemra), which blocks IL-6 signaling.  When people with severe COVID-19 received tocilizumab, their levels of the blood clotting PA-1 protein decreased. Also, the drug eased symptoms and improved critical illness for these patients. Researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSTL) have devised a new intranasal vaccine, tested in mice with COVID-19. Similar to the Russian vaccine, WUSTL’s counterpart also uses a modified adenovirus inserted with the coronavirus’ spike protein.  In mice, one vaccine dose protected against infection with SARS-CoV-2.  Speaking to MNT about their findings, senior study author Prof. Michael S. Diamond explained that the intranasal vaccine would not use a live form of the virus. This made it safer than other vaccines administered through the nose, such as the regular influenza vaccine. “In these mouse models, the vaccine is highly protective. We’re looking forward to beginning the next round of studies and ultimately testing it in people to see if we can induce the type of protective immunity that we think will not only prevent infection but also curb pandemic transmission of this virus,” said Prof. Diamond. “Any vaccine can cause side effects,” he continued. “However, because the vaccine does not replicate, it could not cause unanticipated infection the way a ‘live’ vaccine could — in this way, it would be safer.” “We will soon begin a study to test this intranasal vaccine in nonhuman primates with a plan to move into human clinical trials as quickly as we can.” — Prof. Michael S. Diamond After much debate, a review pooling data from 19 studies concludes that long-term use of hypertension drugs, known as ACE2 inhibitors, might lower the risk of severe illness from the new coronavirus. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the role of these drugs has been controversial. Some researchers suggest they might worsen outcomes, while other studies show no effect on infection severity. The review, which is the largest meta-analysis on the subject, found that COVID-19 patients with high blood pressure who took the drugs were 33% less likely to die or have severe illness than patients with hypertension who did not take them. Lead researcher Dr. Vassilios Vassiliou, of the Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia, United Kingdom, comments on the findings. He says, “[T]he important thing we showed was that there is no evidence that these medications might increase the severity of COVID-19 or risk of death,” says Dr. Vassiliou. “On the contrary, we found there was a significantly lower risk of death and critical outcomes, so they might, in fact, have a protective role — particularly in patients with hypertension.”  – Dr. Vassilios Vassiliou He continues: “As the world braces itself for a potential second wave of the infection, it is particularly important that we understand the impact that these medications have in COVID-19 patients. Our research provides substantial evidence to recommend continued use of these medications if the patients were taking them already.” For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.

A new ‘global atlas’ study characterizes insomnia as a novel risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. In total, the researchers identified 19 risk factors and dismissed 21 suggestive risk factors based on insufficient scientific evidence. Globally, around 463 million adults lived with diabetes in 2019, according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). In 2015, approximately 9% of all adults had the condition. Diabetes is a condition where sugar or glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of being absorbed into cells. This occurs when cells either lose their ability to produce the hormone insulin or, in type 2 diabetes, they develop insulin resistance and are unable to use it productively.  Over the years, researchers discovered certain factors increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. These potential risk factors include alcohol consumption, skipping breakfast, daytime napping, anxiety disorders, urinary sodium, certain amino acids and inflammatory factors, and lack of sleep. A new study that appears in the journal Diabetologia identifies 19 risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The Sweden-based researchers further evaluated 21 risk factors that have scarce evidence, and another 15 that reduce the risk of the condition. The team used a method called ‘Mendelian randomization’ (MR) to obtain their findings. This technique blends genetic information and conventional epidemiological methods. It also addresses questions related to causality without biases that could compromise the validity of epidemiological approaches. Associate professor Susanna Larsson and Shuai Yuan of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, used data from the Diabetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis consortium. The duo evaluated 74,124 cases of type 2 diabetes and 824,006 control participants with European ancestry for the study population. The participants’ mean age was around 55 years, and 51.8% of them were male.  The researchers then screened 238 studies before including 40 individual papers in their MR investigation. Among the 97 factors they looked at, only 19 increased diabetes risk.  Insomnia was identified as a novel risk factor — people living with the condition are 17% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those without it. Speaking with Medical News Today, Larsson says, “Daytime napping also appears to be a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, because it is strongly related to insomnia, it’s unclear whether daytime napping is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes.” The other risk factors include:  “It is important to highlight that obesity is still the predominant risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The observed association with insomnia was partially, but not fully mediated by obesity (higher body mass index),” adds Larsson. “The association between depression and type 2 diabetes might, in part, be mediated by insomnia.” The exposures associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes include: In their study, the authors further explain: “Findings should inform public health policies for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes. Prevention strategies should be constructed from multiple perspectives, such as lowering obesity and smoking rates and levels, and improving mental health, sleep quality, educational level, and birth weight.” While the study’s findings offer important information that might be useful in drafting public health policies, its major limitation is the study population’s homogenous nature. According to the IDF, 79% of adults with diabetes live in low- and middle-income countries. Studies have also found that the chance of developing diabetes is significantly higher for Black people — around 66 more cases of diabetes per 1,000 people — compared with white adults.  Larsson admits that major risk factors for type 2 diabetes might partly differ by ancestry. “Unfortunately, we were unable to […] perform similar analyses in populations of non-European ancestry,” she says.

Medical News Today have covered this fast-moving, complex story with live updates on the latest news, interviews with experts, and an ongoing investigation into the deep racial disparities that COVID-19 has helped unmask.  However, this has not stopped us from publishing hundreds of fascinating stories on a myriad of other topics.  We focused on the science of healthy aging this week, launching a new hub that includes the latest installment in our popular “medical myths” series. We also published a Special Investigation into how health influences voting behavior, and we reported on how scientists could use honeybee venom to treat cancer.  Our coverage of the surprising reason that a ketogenic diet may protect against Alzheimer’s disease also proved to be a popular choice for our readers this week.  We also published an article explaining the differences between in vivo and in vitro studies. Here are 10 recent stories that people may have missed amid all the COVID-19 fervor. We also reveal our most-read article of the year so far. This week, we launched a major resource focusing on healthy aging. It contains 60 articles covering the science of aging, age-related conditions, mental health, exercise, and nutrition.  The leading article in our healthy aging hub is the latest installment in our “medical myths” series. This week, we turned our attention to the decline associated with aging. Is it really inevitable, and what can we do to combat it? Learn more here. Health is one of the top issues in the 2020 election, yet low voter turnouts are consistently associated with poorer health. In this Special Feature, we unpicked the complex relationship between health and voting. We asked why poor health reduces the likelihood that people will vote and what policymakers can do about it. Learn more here. This week, we reported on what Prof. Peter Klinken — the chief scientist of Western Australia — called “another wonderful example of where compounds in nature can be used to treat human diseases.” Scientists have found that the active component of honeybee venom rapidly kills two types of difficult-to-treat breast cancer cells. How it does this may also make it useful in combination with existing chemotherapy drugs. Learn more here. A new pilot study has found an association between eating a Mediterranean-style ketogenic diet and a reduced risk of developing mild cognitive impairment. The researchers attribute this to the way the diet altered the fungal population in the gut. However, the study was small and limited, including only 17 participants. Other variables — such as lifestyle, sex, and ethnicity — may also have an effect on the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and the gut’s microorganisms. Learn more here. Fungi aren’t the only thing present in the human gut. This week, we also reported on research using the newly created Gut Virome Database, which is the world’s first comprehensive database of the communities of viruses that are present there. Researchers were able to ascertain that the viral composition of each human gut environment is likely unique and contains 542 distinct viral populations, on average.  Scientists could use this knowledge to design therapies that use bacteriophage viruses to push the microbiome back toward a healthy state. Learn more here. People who consume most of their calories in the evening tend to consume more of them and have a lower quality diet. That was the key finding in a new study of hunger rhythms that MNT covered this week.  For many people, hunger peaks at around 8:00 p.m., but this may have implications for how healthful their diet is. The study found that people who consumed more of their calories during the evening tended to have significantly poorer quality diets. Learn more here. In this new article, we looked at where peppermint oil comes from, how people can use it, its potential benefits, and the risks of using it.
